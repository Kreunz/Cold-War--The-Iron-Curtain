With Israel showing some degree of support for the UN partition plan, it is anyone's guess if peace will be achieved, but no doubt many believe this to be the first step in a series of many. As the Western World begins to establish ties and show their support for the infant state, Israel's Arab neighbors are enraged, still reeling from their previous failure to eliminate Israel. The revived Jewish state has now left its first modern mark on history."

The issues of the conference mainly concerned the fallout from the 1948 Arab-Israeli War - including borders, the split of Jerusalem and the 700,000 Palestinian refugees created by the conflict. The demarcation line established after the conflict, seeing Israel control 60% of the original partition plan for a Palestinian state, has been maintained despite further Israeli demands and to the outrage of the Arab States. In addition, the Israelis refused to allow any refugees back to their old homes and rejected the ‘100,000 refugees offer’ proposed by the UN. While tensions remain high and Egypt and Jordan still occupy the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, it appears that the fragile peace in the region has been maintained and Israel’s admission to the United Nations should help lead to a peaceful future for the incredibly volatile region."
