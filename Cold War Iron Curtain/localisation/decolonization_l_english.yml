 britishdecolonization.1.t:0 "Class B Mandate of Tanganyika"
 britishdecolonization.1.d:0 "The former League of Nations partitioned Imperial German East Africa on July 20, 1922 between Belgium and Britain. Tanganyika was assigned into a Class B Mandate to be released once independence was possible. The new United Nations Trust Territory Committee reassigned us the colony in 1946, and a independence referendum to be supported. Recent polling has showed that 67% of colonists in Tanganyika are in support of independence. With this in mind, Tanganyika does offer a lot of resources and transportation routes for our other colonies in the area. Should we allow Tanganyika to become an independent nation or not?"

 britishdecolonization.111.t:0 "Tanzania Granted Independence"
 britishdecolonization.111.d:0 "The aftermath of World War I brought the Treaty of Versailles to be signed on June 28,1919 by the Central Powers and Entente. The former League of Nations divided up Germany’s colonial empire between the victorious Entente over the next few years. On July 20, 1922 The United Kingdom was given the state of Tanganyika from German East Africa. Tanganyika was placed on a Class B Mandate to be released once independence was possible. The United Nations Trust Territory Committee reassigned Britain the colony in 1946 with the provision that an independence referendum was held. Tanganyika was granted independence after their referendum gained 67% favorability in independence. Julius Nyerere has been selected to run the country. Tanzania now has the choice to make its own decisions."
