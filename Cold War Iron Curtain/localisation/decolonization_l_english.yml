 britishdecolonization.1.t:0 "Class B Mandate of Tanganyika"
 britishdecolonization.1.d:0 "The former League of Nations partitioned Imperial German East Africa on July 20, 1922 between Belgium and Britain. Tanganyika was assigned into a Class B Mandate to be released once independence was possible. The new United Nations Trust Territory Committee reassigned us the colony in 1946, and a independence referendum to be supported. Recent polling has showed that 67% of colonists in Tanganyika are in support of independence. With this in mind, Tanganyika does offer a lot of resources and transportation routes for our other colonies in the area. Should we allow Tanganyika to become an independent nation or not?"
 britishdecolonization.1.a:0 "Tanganyika shall become an independent nation."
