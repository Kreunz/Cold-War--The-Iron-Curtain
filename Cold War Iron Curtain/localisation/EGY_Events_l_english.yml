 black_saturday.1.d:0 "Following the death of 50 Egyptian policemen in the city of Ismailia at the hands of British soldiers, rebellion erupted all throughout Cairo. Beginning with a strike against British airplanes in Almaza Airport, the riot spread through the city. Policemen, students, and protestors marched to the Prime Minister's office to demand war with the United Kingdom. After being told Farouk I was denying the state of war, the mob moved to Abdeen Palace. Many British and Western institutions were burnt down, along with nightclubs frequented by the King. A total of 3.4 million pounds were lost in the looting and rioting that occurred.  The Egyptian Army managed to arrive before sunset and quell the riots."

 farouk_gang.1.d:0 "King Farouk has announced today that all red cars in Egypt are banned effective immediately and only he is allowed to own any. King Farouk has been known to only drive red cars and has a large fleet of them. Much of King Farouk’s loyalists have praised the law stating that the King should be the only one who is worthy to use such vehicles. Anonymous opponents have criticized the law as “absolutely insane” and “completely meaningless”. Several individuals have come to the anonymous interview simply to state that King Farouk shot out their tires when passing them on the road and accused him of jealousy over others’ red cars."
 farouk_gang.2.d:0 "Princess Fathia has been banned from Egypt after an affair with Riyad Ghali. Recently, it has become public note that Riyad Ghali, royal advisor to the King of Egypt, has proposed to Princess Fathia of Egypt. Despite strong objections from King Farouk, the marriage proceeded at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco. It was also brought to light that both of them have converted to Catholicism and plan to live together. In response, King Farouk has announced that Princess Fathia are banned from Egypt and excommunicated. All of their possessions still in Egypt have been confiscated by the state."
 farouk_gang.3.d:0 "Queen Narriman returned to Egypt and filed for a divorce after her husband cheated on her in France by sleeping with many women including the Swedish movie star Brigitta Stenberg. King Farouk, after voyaging to France, has spent his years since the exile partying in nightclubs, gambling in casinos, and drinking heavily. Different people have had varying experiences with him. Many of the women he slept with loved him but he was notorious for offending others with his hubris. This behavior even caused him to be banned from some establishments in his time in France. People have loved him, and people have hated him. Farouk has left a distinct touch on the French nightlife in his visit no matter what others think of him."
 free_officer_fail.1.d:0 "After sieging King Farouk’s palace, the Free Officers decided to mount an attack. They were up against approximately 800 well-rested and well equipped Sudanese guardsmen who were loyal to the king. In the evening, the Free Officers began an assault against King Farouk. King Farouk, who was an expert marksman, also participated in the fight killing approximately 16 attackers who were attempting to cross the Palace grounds. The Free Officers, desperate to maintain the offensive and kill the King, decided against a withdrawal. Unable to pierce the fortified palace and being constantly harassed by the King himself from a distance, the Free Officers sustained extreme casualties. After the attack, King Farouk immediately ordered a counter-attack against the now disorganized and severely wounded Free Officer siege camp. Poorly defended, all of the Free Officers with the exception of Nasser, were killed. Approximately 30 of the remaining seigers surrendered but King Farouk executed them personally because he would not tolerate treason. Our noble King Farouk today has declared a state of emergency. There is now a manhunt underway to find the traitorous Nasser and bring him to justice. Additionally, the King has called on all patriotic Egyptians to enlist in the army as he is beginning a large buildup to maintain security in the region."
 nasser_execution.1.d:0 "The hunt for Nasser has finally come to a close. After a long and arduous manhunt, Egyptian police found the traitorous Nasser held up in a cell inside of Cairo. After establishing a blockade, the Sudanese guard was called in to arrest Nasser and kill the defenders of the building. Nasser was brought before King Farouk where he stood a fair and just trial for his crimes. It was ultimately decided that his crime must be capitally punished and was executed by strangulation personally by King Farouk."
 sudan_part.1.d:0 "The fight against British rule had the Sudanese region embroiled in a terrible conflict. Our noble King Farouk desiring to maintain order and peace, established a peacekeeping mission. Not wanting to contribute to the conflict, Egyptian forces built garrisons and administrative headquarters to ensure order. After 4 years, the conflict has finally come to an end with the British colonial garrison withdrawing and Sudanese forces almost depleted. Because the only remaining organized Sudanese force remains in the south, King Farouk has established control over the anarchic Sudanese region. The South Sudanese government has sent a formal protest to the King over this, but King Farouk responded stating they were in no condition to govern the ravaged north. King Farouk has openly admitted to the Egyptian people that he is not sure South Sudan is even a functional government in its current state. He is currently considering sending peacekeepers to the South to establish order there, too."
 farouk_exiled.1.d:0 "On the morning of the 26th of July, and after heavy fighting in the Alexandrian palace of King Farouk, the Free Officers issued an ultimatum to King Farouk to abdicate and go into exile. Farouk agreed, seeing attempting to defend as hopeless. In the evening, Farouk left Egypt from his yacht El Mahrousa and set sail for Naples. Farouk eventually would live out the remainder of his days in Monaco. Immediately after Farouk left Egypt, his son, Ahmed Faud, was proclaimed the new king of Egypt. The British government has yet to appoint a new Regent Prime Minister. Currently all of Farouk’s possessions are up for auction and the revolutionary government is inviting everyone who can afford to buy in a chance to purchase some of Farouk’s treasures in Alexandria."
 Free_Officer_Coup.1.d:0 "The Free Officer Coup has just succeeded in Cairo and will result in the expelling of King Farouk from the country. King Farouk had long been considered an inept and corrupt ruler by the Free Officers and today their siege has succeeded. Upon hearing that the Free Officers were planning a coup, King Farouk ordered their arrest. However, the Free Officers found out about this order and decided to launch a preemptive attack and evade the arrest. With the inability to arrest the Free Officers, King Farouk got the assistance of the loyal Sudanese guard to fortify his palace. In the evening, the Free Officers mounted a siege and attacked. They were unable to break the fortifications in the palace and were forced to fall back. King Farouk himself killed 4 attackers with his sniper rifle from a makeshift embrasure on his balcony. The next day, armored reinforcements arrived for the Free Officers. The Free Officers issued an ultimatum to King Farouk to surrender, threatening to destroy the palace with artillery. With no way to destroy the reinforcements, King Farouk surrendered."
 Sudan.1.d:0 "After the revolution of 1952 in Egypt broke off the ability for the UK’s forces to reach Sudan, Sudan was able to rebel against the UK and gain its independence easily. However, not all is happy in the Sudanese region. There is a massive level of political fractionalization and huge ideological and ethnic divides in the country. The new Sudanese government cannot even decide on how to comprise the new government or a fair way to decide which one should rule the country. The most pressing issues include the lack of civil service workers, a lack of industrialization to support the independent nation, rebellion in the South, and many other problems. If the country is unable to resolve these issues, it may experience serious problems in the coming years."
 abolish_mon_egy.1.d:0 "The transitional government of Egypt has abolished the monarchy. The rule of King Farouk’s son, King Faud II, was very short lived as his appointment was only a ruse to appease the British. Gamal Abdel Nasser has been appointed deputy premier and General Naguib has has been appointed as the first president. With the abolition of the monarchy came the newly founded Constitution of the Republic of Egypt. The Constitution has promised secularism and civil rights.\nThere are, however, many individuals who were loyal to the king who are angry that they will no longer receive benefits and spoils from the king. Angrier than the former officers and loyalists, the Muslim Brotherhood is staunchly opposed to the secularism of the new republic and may cause issues for the newly founded Republic if not dealt with."
 egy_trial.1.d:0 "The Royal Officers, military officers loyal to the King, are being put on trial for collusion in crimes against Egypt. The charges include things such as general corruption and abuse of power but many officers are being brought to trial for specific offenses such as brutality or direct theft. The trials will take a long period of time and more complex cases where evidence is hard to gather will likely last for months. Already, some officers have attempted to flee the country in an attempt to escape potential punishment."
 egy_rioting.1.d:0 "After months of firebranding, the Islamic Brotherhood is currently participating in a massive statewide riot. The Islamic Brotherhood has, since the first drafting of the Egyptian Constitution, despised the newly founded Republic. Their primary complaints are the secularization of the country and the liberalization of the Muslim faith under the political atmosphere of the government. Many leading theorists such as Sayyid Qutb have published works declaring that Egypt has become no longer Islamic and that the state must be overthrown. Already, rioters have taken over key regions in multiple cities across Egypt and are destroying government property en masse. Government security forces are clashing heavily with the rioters in the streets."
 egy_suez_funding.1.d:0 "The Aswan High Dam has finally received funding and will be built across the Nile. The Dam is expected to span ~3800 meters with a tremendous height of ~110m. The dam will support industrialization with its electricity, control flooding, provide water infrastructure, and irrigate farmlands for large distances. Additionally, the dam will create a lake that has been prematurely named “Lake Nasser” after the revolutionary leader. Currently the Egyptian government is beginning mass hirings and contractings in order to accumulate the manpower and resources necessary to build the dam now that the funding has been secured."
