 air_disaster.1.d:0 "Late last night, a Korean Airlines Flight from Ted Stevens International Airport in Anchorage, Alaska bound for Gimpo International Airport in Seoul, South Korea strayed into Soviet airspace at 15:51 UTC over the Kamchatka peninsula and was shot down following the failure of the aircraft to react to warning signs and communications from the Soviet military. A Soviet Sukhoi SU-15 shot down the civilian airliner, with the Georgian Congressman, Larry McDonald, on board. All 269 passengers onboard have perished."
 air_disaster.2.d:0 "Earlier this afternoon, an El Al Flight from Vienna's Wien-Schwechat International Airport bound for Tel Aviv's Lod Airport was shot down over the People’s Republic of Bulgaria due to deviating from its planned course. The cause of this deviation is unknown at the moment. It has been established that the flight, flying at Fl180, left the Amber 10 airway and strayed 200 miles into Bulgarian territory. The aircraft had ignored warning shells fired off by MiG-15s which had been stationed to defend Sofia. Pinchas Ben-Porat, the man who led to the formation of the Israeli Air Force, the IAF’s 101st Squadron, and El Al died on board."
 air_disaster.3.d:0 "Tragedy struck this afternoon at the  Llandow aerodrome as an Avro Tudor V named 'Star Girl' crashed after attempting to land at the Llandow aerodrome, eyewitnesses said that the aircraft approached the runway at an abnormal low altitude with it’s undercarriage down. Only 3 people survived this crash while 8 had made it to hospital but died due to their wounds. As it stands this is the most deadly air incident in Wales. "
 air_disaster.4.d:0 "A grave loss of life has occured at the Los Rodeos Airport today. Two 747s, one from KLM and one from Pan American, crashed in the fog while attempting to depart. After being diverted due to a terrorist attack at Gran Canaria Airport, the congestion at Los Rodeos led to the accident where 583 souls lost their lives. 61 people survived the incident, and they were all seated on the Pan American aircraft. This has become the most deadly air incident in the world."
 air_disaster.5.d:0 "A tragedy struck the world of Rock and Roll. During the Winter Dance Party Tour of Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and J. P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson, their chartered V-Tail Bonanza from Beechcraft disappeared into the snow surrounding Mason City Municipal Airport and was soon found smoldering in a cornfield at 9:35 AM less than six miles from the airport. This day, Feburary 3rd, 1959, will be as some say, The Day the Music Died."
 air_disaster.6.d:0 "\nFollowing the crash of an American Airlines DC-10 at O’Hare International Airport the Federal Aviation Administration under chief Langhorne Bond said that tonight, on July 6th, 1979 that all U.S based DC-10s which number up to 138 and also all DC-10s from countries with bilateral agreements with the U.S would be grounded. All DC-10s are also banned from flying in U.S airspace except for foreign carriers returning their DC-10s to their maintenance bases."
 adlai_civil.1.d:0 "On May 7th the Supreme Court of the United States handed down the landmark Brown vs Board case. In a unanimous vote by all 9 court members, they agreed that educating races separately was unconstitutional, thereby overwriting the Plessy v Ferguson case from 1897 which held up segregation laws. The case began with a class-action lawsuit filed against the Board of Education by the city of Topeka in Kansas, represented by Oliver Brown, and soon came under review by the Supreme Court. Their decision caused great unrest in the south, being seen as a threat to their traditional order. In a shocking move by President Adlai Stevenson, he has refused to enforce the act and stated that he intends to allow any schools that wish to retain educational segregation to do so. This decision has prompted great outrage from Liberal elements within the Democratic Party and there are scattered calls for the impeachment of the President. However, it seems unlikely any of these calls will come to fruition, and the South’s position as well as that of the segregationist movement has been greatly strengthened."

 farouk_gang.1.d:0 "King Farouk has announced today that all red cars in Egypt are banned effective immediately and only he is allowed to own any. King Farouk has been known to only drive red cars and has a large fleet of them. Much of King Farouk’s loyalists have praised the law stating that the King should be the only one who is worthy to use such vehicles. Anonymous opponents have criticized the law as “absolutely insane” and “completely meaningless”. Several individuals have come to the anonymous interview simply to state that King Farouk shot out their tires when passing them on the road and accused him of jealousy over others’ red cars."
 farouk_gang.2.d:0 "Princess Fathia has been banned from Egypt after an affair with Riyad Ghali. Recently, it has become public note that Riyad Ghali, royal advisor to the King of Egypt, has proposed to Princess Fathia of Egypt. Despite strong objections from King Farouk, the marriage proceeded at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco. It was also brought to light that both of them have converted to Catholicism and plan to live together. In response, King Farouk has announced that Princess Fathia are banned from Egypt and excommunicated. All of their possessions still in Egypt have been confiscated by the state."
 farouk_gang.3.d:0 "Queen Narriman returned to Egypt and filed for a divorce after her husband cheated on her in France by sleeping with many women including the Swedish movie star Brigitta Stenberg. King Farouk, after voyaging to France, has spent his years since the exile partying in nightclubs, gambling in casinos, and drinking heavily. Different people have had varying experiences with him. Many of the women he slept with loved him but he was notorious for offending others with his hubris. This behavior even caused him to be banned from some establishments in his time in France. People have loved him, and people have hated him. Farouk has left a distinct touch on the French nightlife in his visit no matter what others think of him."
 free_officer_fail.1.d:0 "After sieging King Farouk’s palace, the Free Officers decided to mount an attack. They were up against approximately 800 well-rested and well equipped Sudanese guardsmen who were loyal to the king. In the evening, the Free Officers began an assault against King Farouk. King Farouk, who was an expert marksman, also participated in the fight killing approximately 16 attackers who were attempting to cross the Palace grounds. The Free Officers, desperate to maintain the offensive and kill the King, decided against a withdrawal. Unable to pierce the fortified palace and being constantly harassed by the King himself from a distance, the Free Officers sustained extreme casualties. After the attack, King Farouk immediately ordered a counter-attack against the now disorganized and severely wounded Free Officer siege camp. Poorly defended, all of the Free Officers with the exception of Nasser, were killed. Approximately 30 of the remaining seigers surrendered but King Farouk executed them personally because he would not tolerate treason. Our noble King Farouk today has declared a state of emergency. There is now a manhunt underway to find the traitorous Nasser and bring him to justice. Additionally, the King has called on all patriotic Egyptians to enlist in the army as he is beginning a large buildup to maintain security in the region."
 nasser_execution.1.d:0 "The hunt for Nasser has finally come to a close. After a long and arduous manhunt, Egyptian police found the traitorous Nasser held up in a cell inside of Cairo. After establishing a blockade, the Sudanese guard was called in to arrest Nasser and kill the defenders of the building. Nasser was brought before King Farouk where he stood a fair and just trial for his crimes. It was ultimately decided that his crime must be capitally punished and was executed by strangulation personally by King Farouk."
 sudan_part.1.d:0 "The fight against British rule had the Sudanese region embroiled in a terrible conflict. Our noble King Farouk desiring to maintain order and peace, established a peacekeeping mission. Not wanting to contribute to the conflict, Egyptian forces built garrisons and administrative headquarters to ensure order. After 4 years, the conflict has finally come to an end with the British colonial garrison withdrawing and Sudanese forces almost depleted. Because the only remaining organized Sudanese force remains in the south, King Farouk has established control over the anarchic Sudanese region. The South Sudanese government has sent a formal protest to the King over this, but King Farouk responded stating they were in no condition to govern the ravaged north. King Farouk has openly admitted to the Egyptian people that he is not sure South Sudan is even a functional government in its current state. He is currently considering sending peacekeepers to the South to establish order there, too."
 farouk_exiled.1.d:0 "On the morning of the 26th of July, and after heavy fighting in the Alexandrian palace of King Farouk, the Free Officers issued an ultimatum to King Farouk to abdicate and go into exile. Farouk agreed, seeing attempting to defend as hopeless. In the evening, Farouk left Egypt from his yacht El Mahrousa and set sail for Naples. Farouk eventually would live out the remainder of his days in Monaco. Immediately after Farouk left Egypt, his son, Ahmed Faud, was proclaimed the new king of Egypt. The British government has yet to appoint a new Regent Prime Minister. Currently all of Farouk’s possessions are up for auction and the revolutionary government is inviting everyone who can afford to buy in a chance to purchase some of Farouk’s treasures in Alexandria."

 Free_Officer_Coup.1.d:0 "The Free Officer Coup has just succeeded in Cairo and will result in the expelling of King Farouk from the country. King Farouk had long been considered an inept and corrupt ruler by the Free Officers and today their siege has succeeded. Upon hearing that the Free Officers were planning a coup, King Farouk ordered their arrest. However, the Free Officers found out about this order and decided to launch a preemptive attack and evade the arrest. With the inability to arrest the Free Officers, King Farouk got the assistance of the loyal Sudanese guard to fortify his palace. In the evening, the Free Officers mounted a siege and attacked. They were unable to break the fortifications in the palace and were forced to fall back. King Farouk himself killed 4 attackers with his sniper rifle from a makeshift embrasure on his balcony. The next day, armored reinforcements arrived for the Free Officers. The Free Officers issued an ultimatum to King Farouk to surrender, threatening to destroy the palace with artillery. With no way to destroy the reinforcements, King Farouk surrendered."
 Sudan.1.d:0 "After the revolution of 1952 in Egypt broke off the ability for the UK’s forces to reach Sudan, Sudan was able to rebel against the UK and gain its independence easily. However, not all is happy in the Sudanese region. There is a massive level of political fractionalization and huge ideological and ethnic divides in the country. The new Sudanese government cannot even decide on how to comprise the new government or a fair way to decide which one should rule the country. The most pressing issues include the lack of civil service workers, a lack of industrialization to support the independent nation, rebellion in the South, and many other problems. If the country is unable to resolve these issues, it may experience serious problems in the coming years."
 abolish_mon_egy.1.d:0 "The transitional government of Egypt has abolished the monarchy. The rule of King Farouk’s son, King Faud II, was very short lived as his appointment was only a ruse to appease the British. Gamal Abdel Nasser has been appointed deputy premier and General Naguib has has been appointed as the first president. With the abolition of the monarchy came the newly founded Constitution of the Republic of Egypt. The Constitution has promised secularism and civil rights.\nThere are, however, many individuals who were loyal to the king who are angry that they will no longer receive benefits and spoils from the king. Angrier than the former officers and loyalists, the Muslim Brotherhood is staunchly opposed to the secularism of the new republic and may cause issues for the newly founded Republic if not dealt with."
 egy_trial.1.d:0 "The Royal Officers, military officers loyal to the King, are being put on trial for collusion in crimes against Egypt. The charges include things such as general corruption and abuse of power but many officers are being brought to trial for specific offenses such as brutality or direct theft. The trials will take a long period of time and more complex cases where evidence is hard to gather will likely last for months. Already, some officers have attempted to flee the country in an attempt to escape potential punishment."
 egy_rioting.1.d:0 "After months of firebranding, the Islamic Brotherhood is currently participating in a massive statewide riot. The Islamic Brotherhood has, since the first drafting of the Egyptian Constitution, despised the newly founded Republic. Their primary complaints are the secularization of the country and the liberalization of the Muslim faith under the political atmosphere of the government. Many leading theorists such as Sayyid Qutb have published works declaring that Egypt has become no longer Islamic and that the state must be overthrown. Already, rioters have taken over key regions in multiple cities across Egypt and are destroying government property en masse. Government security forces are clashing heavily with the rioters in the streets."
 egy_suez_funding.1.d:0 "The Aswan High Dam has finally received funding and will be built across the Nile. The Dam is expected to span ~3800 meters with a tremendous height of ~110m. The dam will support industrialization with its electricity, control flooding, provide water infrastructure, and irrigate farmlands for large distances. Additionally, the dam will create a lake that has been prematurely named “Lake Nasser” after the revolutionary leader. Currently the Egyptian government is beginning mass hirings and contractings in order to accumulate the manpower and resources necessary to build the dam now that the funding has been secured."
 truman_civil.1.d:0 "On May 7th the Supreme Court of the United States, under Chief Justice Earl Warren, handed down the landmark Brown vs Board case. In a unanimous vote by all 9 court members, they agreed that educating races separately was unconstitutional, thereby overwriting the Plessy v Ferguson case from 1897 which held up segregation laws. The case began with a class-action lawsuit filed against the Board of Education by the city of Topeka in Kansas, represented by Oliver Brown, and soon came under review by the Supreme Court. Their decision caused great unrest in the southern states, being seen as a threat to their traditional order. President Truman has always been known as being in favour of civil rights, passing the very first legislation desegregating the military in 1948. To no surprise, Truman has announced before congress his intentions to immediately enforce the ruling throughout the country. While causing considerable unrest in the south, actual resistance has been limited. Despite scattered calls for his impeachment by Dixiecrats within the Democratic Party, no solid base of opposition has formed, and it appears that the President will face no considerable political threats in the near future. How the southern states will handle these rapid changes and adapt to the new political climate remains a matter of contention."
 SKnews.4.d:0 "Earlier this morning in Seoul, an assassination attempt against Chang Myon failed. A sniper in the Sigong building attacked the Vice President and he received a penetrating wound to the wrist. Immediately, security forces moved to shield Chang Myon and chase the sniper. The sniper attempted to flee but was arrested. Chang Myon is currently in the hospital seeing to his injuries and an investigation is being mounted. The primary suspect to the incident is the Liberal Party who are the only ones who may desire to kill the vice president. The attack has been publicly condemned by supporters and members of the liberal party."
 SKnews.2.d:0 "Cho Bang-am, the former Progressive Party candidate, has been found guilty of espionage and sentenced to death. After his first trial failed to accrue enough evidence to convict him several months ago, a more recent trial had found conclusive evidence that Cho Bang-am had been funded by North Korea. The evidence that Cho Bang-am has been conspiring against South Korea has led to increased tensions between the 2 nations. Already, there is public outrage and fear that North Korea may make another attempt to infiltrate the South Korean government. The heightened state of affairs has led to an increased state of awareness in the country and additional funding to audit systems."
 SKnews.1.d:0 "For more than half a millenia, the Korean Peninsula was ruled by a dynasty similar to its neighbor to the north, the Yi Dynasty. However, thanks to inefficient bureaucracy, corruption, and the weakening power of its Qing protectors, the Yi Dynasty was deposed from their rule, and was replaced by the local administration of the Empire of Japan. However, hope for monarchism and the restoration of the Yi Dynasty has been restored, for the Yi Dynasty was able to overthrow the provisional government placed by the United States and overseen by Syngman Rhee and restore their imperial rule over the Southern half of the Korean Peninsula. This chain of events in the Korean Peninsula is unprecedented, and the United States have yet to respond, but are likely to support the monarchist rule. However, the DPRK or North Korea doesn’t seemed pleased, and have mobilized more troops to the DMZ to ensure its security."
 SKnews.5.d:0 "Hopes for Korean reunification and reinvigorated nationalism in the Republic of Korea have ended today, as its prominent advocate, Kim Koo, was assassinated today in his residence. According to local police, Ahn Doo-hee, a lieutenant in the ROK Army, burst inside the residence of Kim Koo and shot him 4 times. According to Ahn, he claims that he has sole responsibility for the assassination, claiming it was done of his own fruition, and that no other party played a role in Kim Koo’s assassination. He also stated that Kim Koo is allegedly a collaborator with the Soviet Union, and that his presence in South Korea serves as a breeding ground for rebellion and insurgency. However, observers believe otherwise, and they speculate that the assassination attempt was actually orchestrated by the Rhee administration itself in an effort to consolidate power and influence throughout the Republic. Nevertheless, this assassination will be a stain in the Rhee administration’s reputation, and serves as a precedent for the consequences of political dissent in the nation."
 SKnews.3.d:0 "A period of both national and international uproar has occurred today, as recent evidence has came to light that government forces have organized mass slaughter of civilians in the Republic of Korea. The massacres, organized none other than by the Rhee administration itself, have claimed that these massacres are necessary since the victims are communist sympathizers, people who would institute a revolution if they weren’t sacrificed for the nation. Such rhetoric hasn’t convinced the people of South Korea or the world rather, with condemnation coming from various nations, with the United States, the sole backer of South Korea, have yet to respond. This act is thought by observers as something that has reinvigorated opposition to the Rhee administration, not acceptance of it."
 SKnews.6.d:0 "Democracy is slowly fading to the abyss in the young republic, as President Syngman Rhee has extended term limits for his office, eventually paving the way for an authoritarian regime. While extending term limits is considered by many as nothing since they could simply lose an election, the fact is that the extended term limits coupled with allegations of election fraud have been seen by many observers as a dictatorship. While the Rhee administration hasn’t given out an official statement as to why they extended term limits, it is perfectly clear that Syngman Rhee will use this to consolidate his position in South Korea, and ensure opposition to his regime is manageable or even non-existent."
 DDR_Harich.1.d:0 "The aversion against the Stalinist Soviet occupation of East Germany has boiled over and resulted in a takeover by the Harich Group. Germans across the country, outraged at the persecution of the group, have risen up. The court where the Harish Group members were being held has been overrun and the members have been freed. The NKVD camps have been stormed and general strikes have placed the country into a deadlock.\nFrom the chaos, the Harich Group has taken de facto control over the country and promised to bring liberal reforms to the country. Already, Stalinist loyalists have begun to flee the country fearing that they may be killed by the rebellious Harich supporters."
 DDR_Harich.10.d:0 "Desiring the unity and particularist autonomy of the German people, the East German government has called for Pan-German elections. Citing that the German people no longer wish to be controlled by foreign powers but rather be free to govern themselves, the East German government has pledged its support for these elections. The East German government has also outlined a series of plans on how these elections will work and properly represent the will of the German people.\nWhile Germans support this proposal fervently, it has drawn internal division within’ the 2 sphere who are skeptical that it would be within’ their best interests. Both sides have yet to release official statements or positions on the matter."
 ulbricht_purge.1.d:0 "Walter Ulbricht, the First Secretary of the German Democratic-Republic, has been executed on the order of Heinrich Rau. Soon after the death of Stalin, massive riots broke out across the country. The pro-Stalinist leaders have failed to contain the riots and they have become a full revolution, deposing the pro-Stalinist government.\nHeinrich Rau, the Chairman of the Economic Commission, has become the de facto leader. Immediately after gaining power, Heinrich Rau has accused Ulbricht to be a traitor to the German people and a puppet installed by the Soviets to manipulate German workers into following a defunct sect of Marxism. Ulbricht was given a very long trial with extensive representation and has been found guilty of conspiring against the German people. Fearing Ulbricht’s supporters may attempt to intercept the convoy, Ulbricht was executed immediately behind the courtroom."
 ddr_zaisser_purged.1.d:0 "Wilhelm Zaisser, the Minister of State Security of the German Democratic-Republic has been removed from power on the order of Walter Ulbricht. Following the suppressed Worker’s Uprising, Ulbricht has resecured his position and ordered the execution of Rau and several others he has labelled as “the enemies of the state”.\nThe full list of charges brought against Wilhelm Zaisser include poor standing with the rest of the party, associating with others who have poor standing, being an enemy of the people, and not using enough of the repressive power of the Stasi during the uprising.\nZaisser has been stripped of his position but will continue to work as a translator at the Institute of Marxism and Leninism in East Berlin."
 mielke_purged.1.d:0 "Erich Mielke, the Security Chief of the Economic Commission of the German Democratic-Republic, has been removed from power on the order of Heinrich Rau. Accused of operations against the people, Erich was given a lengthy trial and eventually found guilty but not of all charges. Erich Mielke has been stripped of his position and will be sent to work as a translator in the Institute of Marxism and Leninism in East Berlin.\nThe charges of being an enemy of the people and an corruptor of Marx’s teachings have passed but conspiracy and treason charges have not. It was decided that time spent reading and translating Marx’s works and the philosophies of true Marxists would aid Erich Mielke to see the true light of socialism. "
 anti_harich_group.1.d:0 "The Harich Group, a circle of like-minded liberal marxists, have been arrested and put on trial.\nThe group, led by Wolfgang Harich, has long supported the liberalization of society and the overthrow of the illiberal Stalin reforms. The members of the group have desired to bring an end to the Stasi and bring on civil rights reforms in the country.\nAfter extensive investigations and interrogations, most of the group’s key members have been arrested and charged for being an enemy of the people. The trial’s evidence comprises mostly of public positions held by the members of the group and a vast number of anonymous witnesses to backdoor deals. The members have all been sentenced either to death or will continue to work low-risk jobs under arrest."
 ddr_media.1.d:0 "The Deutscher Fernsehfunk (DFF), the official state television broadcaster, has just been made its debut. For a long time, radio has been the primary source of broadcasting in East Germany. However, around the early 50s, television has been growing in popularity. Soon after its popularity, the expansion of television had been added to the most recent 5-year-plan. Within; years the DFF was established and will bring high-quality entertainment and education to the masses.\nThe programming available is as follows:\nMarxist education for children\nDaily News within’ the communist sphere\nWeekly reports on the state of affairs\nComedy shows featuring popular figureheads\nVariety Acts\nKnowledge-Based Game Shows\nThe History Program\nAnd more coming soon"
 waldheimer_prozesse.1.d:0 "3442 Nazi war and domestic atrocity criminals are on trial today in Waldheim. These individuals are being charged with a variety of crimes including crimes against humanity, mass murder, war crimes, and many other crimes. The defendants are amongst the last of the Nazi war criminals who have yet to be tried for their crimes. The trials will be carried out in quick succession due to the large numbers of individuals on trial. Several independent reporters are claiming that the trials are not fair and being conducted too quickly with most defendants only getting a few minutes on trial. Most troubling of these reports is a 14 year old boy named Walter Jurisch who has been sentenced to 20 years. One of the prosecutors has responded by stating that they are Nazis and Nazis do not have rights. Another prosecutor has claimed that it is a “grace that the enemies of the People’s Republic get a trial at all”."
 congo_mutiny.1.d:0 "Though the Congo formally declared independence from Belgium on June 30 1960, the day to day of the ex colony has remained mostly the same, with many of its colonial institutions still operating in the state. One of these institutions, the Force Publique, has been the focus of significant backlash in the Congo. Although Belgium has formally withdrawn from the colony, many high ranking officials in the Force Publique have remained Belgian, much to the chagrin of the black members of the force. These tensions came to a head today when several all black units mutinied against their Belgian officers in response to Commander-in-Chief Emile Janssen's declaration that the situation after independence would not change from before independence. These units pushed several miles through the Congolese countryside, taking many Belgians hostage and recruiting more soldiers. Although Janssen attempted organise troops to crush the mutineers, the new government instead favored negotiations that have resulted in the reformation of the Force Publique into the Armee Nationale Congolaise, as well as the expulsion of Belgian officers."       
 mobutu_cos.1.d:0 "\n\nMobutu, the Congolese garrison officer, is being appointed today as the chief of staff of the Congolese colonial garrison. In an attempt to Africanise the garrison’s leadership to ease tensions with the soldiers, Colonel Mobutu was appointed as the Chief of Staff. His appointment was widely accepted by the ministers in charge of the appointment as the other candidate Maurice Mpolo isn’t trusted. Fearing that Maurice may enact a coup d’etat because he held influence with the mutinied soldiers, Mobutu has been entrusted with the position instead."         
 lumumba_deposed.1.d:0 "Lumumba, the first Prime Minister of the Congo, has been deposed after a few months in power. Dissent and discontent have been spreading in the Congo for a while now and mutinies have only been getting worse.\nMobutu Sese Seko, the Chief of Staff of the Congolese armed forces, with the support of the US and Belgium, has just arrested the first Prime Minister. Lumumba is currently being taken to Port Francqui in the south of the Congo."     
 un_congo.1.d:0 "A few days after the Congolese mutiny, Belgian troops invaded the Congo in an attempt to restore order due to Tshombe’s secessionist forces are growing stronger. This has led the first Prime Minister Lumumba to appeal for a UN intervention to resolve the situation. Lumumba is stating that the invasion of Congo by Belgian forces is an act of unwarranted aggression and an attempt to reinstate the colonial control of Belgium over the Congo. Additionally, Lumumba has repeatedly petitioned the UN forces to subdue the rebel government led by Tshombe.\nThe UN is expected to respond within a few days."             
 un_congo.2.d:0 "The Congolese government, in a security meeting with other members of the council over the post-colonial situation in the Congo, is stating that the UN is incompetent. Upset over the UN security force’s inability to ensure order or to expel Belgian forces from the area, Lumumba has protested by stating the UN is incapable of resolving the situation. The UN declared in response that they will urge the Belgians to speedily withdraw their troops from the Congo."             
 congo_un.20.d:0 "As months go by without a clear resolution, the Congolese government has accused the UN of siding with Tshombe and foreign mining companies. The Congolese government, today, is demanding that UN forces withdraw from the country and stop interfering with the country.\nThese demands stem from months of disagreements between the Congolese government and the United Nations over the peacekeeping mandate; specifically on the issue of Katanga. The UNhas adamantly refused to retake Katanga claiming that it is an internal matter and they are forbidden to intervene due to Article 2 of the United Nations Charter.\nThe Congo is currently petitioning the Soviet Union for immediate security aid to deal with the situation."             
 un_congo.3.d:0 "The Congolese government has issued an ultimatum to the UN to immediately withdraw their forces. Infuriated by the growth of UN forces in the Congo and the refusal of UN troops to suppress the Katangese secession movement, the Congo has issued a final ultimatum to the UN to withdraw immediately. If this demand is not met, the Congo will receive Soviet aid and mount an attack against the secessionist province of Katanga."            
 belgium_congo.1.d:0 "Infuriated by the Belgian incursion into the Congo and unsatisfied with the excuse of them being there to protect Belgian nationals, the Congolese government is demanding that Belgium immediately withdraw their troops from the Congo.\nTensions have continued to mount as Belgium has increased the size of its local garrisons in the region. The Congolese government fears that they may reinstate colonial rule or coerce the Congolese government.\nThe Belgian government has responded by restating their purpose and are saying they will withdraw as soon as they can ensure security or be replaced with a UN garrison that can do the same."        
 lumumba_death.1.d:0 "Though execution sounds like a clean word, the death of former Congolese Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba is anything but. Over the months of December 1960 and January 1961, Lumumba was sent through hell, underfed and "living amid absolutely impossible conditions" in Camp Hardy, until soldiers even refused to work. He would eventually be restrained and flown to Elisabethville where he would be beaten and tortured by both Katangan and Belgian officers, until he and two others were executed by firing squad on January 17 1961 with Belgian officers present. In order to get rid of the bodies, the executioners dismembered and boiled away the bodies in sulfuric acid, then crushed and scattered the bones. Although the Katangan government officially stands by their three week late report that he was killed by angry villagers, people from Belgrade to New York City are up in arms over this tragic and tyrannical display."        
 mobutu.2.d:0 "Lumumba’s Sovereign Guard have prevented a coup and killed Mobutu. Fearful of an attempted coup by Mobutu, Lumumba secretly assembled a secret service special forces unit known as the Sovereign Guard of the Congo. The Sovereign Guard of the Congo have members hand picked from the best of the Congolese armed forces and trained by the Soviet Union. Lumumba assigned the guard to defend him and be ready to strike against Mobutu if necessary.\nOn the day Mobutu launched his coup, the SGC picked up a confidential note of the attack and assembled an ambush. En route, Mobutu’s force was ambushed and overrun by SGC forces armed with modified Soviet flamethrowers. The SGC, under cover of smoke, managed to douse Mobutu’s force in fire. No SGC members were killed and Mobutu perished in the flame with his close loyalists.\nLumumba has declared an immediate state of emergency and is organizing a force to drive out illegal foreign corporations and enemies of the Congo. The counterattack itself has brought massive political gains and is drawing patriotic recruits and regional mercenaries who are too scared to work for Lumumba’s enemies even for a higher price."             
 mobutu.3.d:0 "The ONUC is currently cracking down on all mercenary units within’ the Congo.. The UN has issued a resolution calling for the total withdrawal of all Belgian and Katagan mercenaries units in the Congo. The ONUC has been given a mandate to arrest foreign mercenaries wherever they encounter them.\nThe UN has released a statement on the matter saying that mercenary units are a threat to the stability and peace of the Congo. This has surprised many because the ONUC’s original mandate prevented them from taking sides and this action directly conflicts with that mandate. It is unlikely that such an action will not be met with resistance and is likely to face conflict in the near future."             
 zaire.1.d:0 "During the Congo Crisis from 1960 to 1965, the newly formed Republic of the Congo was engaged in continuous local conflicts with Belgian-backed separatist movements and various rival governments. After political turmoil following the 1965 elections, Colonel Mobutu launched a bloodless coup and assumed total control of the former Belgian Congo. Despite promising to restore democracy, he dissolved parliament and abolished the position of Prime Minister, and in 1967 he founded the MPR, which was the only legal party in the country. Embarking on an Authenticity campaign, Mobutu renamed many Congolese cities to eradicate their colonial legacy and promoted a pro-African cultural attitude. Foreign assets were also nationalised and Mobutu has consolidated his rule to form a highly centralised and tightly regulated government, with him as undisputed dictator. His efforts have come to a conclusion recently, as he has officially declared the renaming of the Republic of the Congo to the Republic of Zaire. Although largely a symbolic move, it represents Mobutu’s complete control over the Congo and his disdain for their colonial legacy, as well as the failure of yet another African democracy."                 
 tshombe.1.d:0 "Tshombe’s leadership is now reaching its 7th year and is being met with much celebration in the streets. Already, the Congo has seen a massive influx of investors coming from foreign countries and the Government Bureau of Labor is assuring everyone that the working conditions are the best in the world. Tshombe is also proud to announce that rehabilitation centers are up and running across the country and are dedicated to reforming individuals who oppose the State of the Congo. As seen in these highly photogenic pictures, the people of the State of the Congo are very happy to be under Tshombe’s benevolent rule.\nHowever, not everyone is happy with our glorious leader’s rule and many independent reporters have falsely claimed “human rights abuses” and “oppression”. The Broadcaster Network of the State of the Congo has refuted these claims with evidence that everything is fine and happy here in the Congo. Unfortunately, many of these reporters have committed highly elaborate suicides very quickly after having their preposterous claims refuted."             
 mobutu_execution.1.d:0 "Mobutu, who was captured by Tshombe’s forces, has been sentenced to death after a speedy trial. Mobutu was found guilty of conspiring against the Congolese people, desiring chaos and power above order and harmony, and being completely inept. Tshombe presented many important pieces of evidence such as Mobutu’s failures as Chief of Staff and Mobutu’s attempt to kill off the Congolese government with no plan to replace it. Additionally, Tshombe has presented evidence that will not be public due to its graphical nature. Such evidence exposed Mobutu’s love of hitting children then selling drugs to those same children to ease the pain of him hitting them then hitting them again. Such shocking and cruel behavior is only fit for the worst of punishments. However, in a bout of mercy, Tshombe sentenced Mobutu to a merciful death at the hands of an alligator."
 mobutu.10.d:0 "With control of the country re-established, it appeared that the Congo Crisis was coming to its end. Since his first coup in 1960, Colonel Mobutu Sese Seko had been consolidating his power - assuring the loyalty of local divisions and sending those with questionable loyalty to remote garrison duties. Following Operation Dragon Rogue, Prime Minister Moise Tshombe lost favour with both President Kasa-Vubu and Mobutu, which would cause a major political crisis in the upcoming 1965 elections. Whilst Tshombe achieved a majority, Kasa-Vubu exploited the defection of a large portion of his party to appoint Evariste Kimba - who was anti-Tshombe - to the position of Prime Minister. The parliament was loyal to Tshombe and rejected the President’s move. This prompted a political deadlock which effectively paralysed the Congolese government. On 25th November, Mobutu broke the deadlock by seizing power in a bloodless yet decisive coup d’etat. Mobutu has declared a state of emergency, giving him virtually unlimited power for at least 5 years. He has promised to restore democracy after the limit, however with considerable internal and foreign support and dictatorial authority, it remains uncertain whether he will be willing to give up his power."

 kef.6.d:0 "In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration was founded in 1906 to promote public health through the regulation of food safety and various medical instruments. With laws relating to public health constantly being updated, calls to empower the FDA have intensified since the end of World War 2, and following Kefauver’s election to the presidency he has appeared somewhat willing to implement reforms to further expand the FDA’s power. Recently, the President has proposed legislation to radically expand the FDA’s authority in public health affairs, and today the changes have been officially ratified by Congress. With the bill coming into effect in the following days, the changes will likely be a major factor in the ongoing fight for the improvement of public health, although the changes have drawn criticism from those arguing against what they perceive as too much government intervention in the lives of American citizens."
 kef.4.d:0 "On May 7th the Supreme Court of the United States, under Chief Justice Earl Warren, handed down the landmark Brown vs Board case. In a unanimous vote by all 9 court members, they agreed that educating races separately was unconstitutional, thereby overwriting the Plessy v Ferguson case from 1897 which held up segregation laws. The case began with a class-action lawsuit filed against the Board of Education by the city of Topeka in Kansas, represented by Oliver Brown, and soon came under review by the Supreme Court. Their decision caused great unrest in the south, being seen as a threat to their traditional order. President Kefauver has always been known as a crusader for civil rights and, only a day after the ruling was handed down, has announced before congress his intentions to ‘uphold the ruling wherever possible’. While only a short speech, this represents a major stride for the civil rights movement in the United States and appears to be a decisive turning point for segregation in America."
 kef.1.d:0 "In a fiery speech before congress, American President Estes Kefauver has officially declared war on the Italian-American mafia, vowing to root them out and ‘restore order’ to American cities. Originating mainly from descendants of Italian immigrants, the mafia rose to prominence during the prohibition era and remain active in many industrial American cities, such as Chicago, operating a vast and well-organised criminal network. Before his rise to the presidency, Kefauver presided over hearings in 1950 that brought nationwide attention to the growing issue of organised crime, and following his election to the presidency many have expected him to take legal action regarding the issue. Until now, the mafia have faced relatively little opposition from law enforcement in building their criminal empire, but it now appears that this will soon change. Reactions to the President’s speech have been varied, however there seems to be a distinct contrast between those strongly in favour of clamping down on organised crime and those who predict the drastic consequences a conflict with the mafia may have on the societies of areas in the direct vicinity of the inevitable conflict. Several congressmen have even suggested that it may be too hard to completely root out the well-established mafia and would only lead to further conflict, anger and damage within urban communities. Regardless of the consequences, this ambitious move will have significant long-term consequences to the lives of many, but whether the attempts will bear fruit remains unforeseeable."
 NNE.1.d:0 "In a landmark case, Loving v Virginia has passed striking down all laws against interracial marriage. The case was brought to trial by Mildred Loving and Richard Loving, an interracial couple who were sentenced to prison in Virginia for marrying each-other. The trial went on for several days but it was eventually unanimously decided that the prohibition was unconstitutional. In addition to the passing of the law, Pace v Alabama was overturned. Pace v Alabama ruled that anti-interracial marriage laws were constitutional.\nThere are mixed reactions throughout the country but the majority sentiment is very positive in favor of the ruling. Civil rights groups are currently celebrating this day and declaring that “Loving Day” is officially a landmark civil rights holiday."
 NNE.2.d:0 "In a landmark case, Roe v Wade has officially declared that restricted access to abortion is unconstitutional, making the US one of the less than five countries in the world with on-demand abortion. The court ruled seven to two that the Due Process Clause protects a women's right to abortion. State and federal restrictions on abortion have been overturned. Roe v Wade has sparked national debates on whether abortion should be legal and to what extent.\nThe country seems heavily divided on the issue and grassroots movements have been activated on both sides. The pro-abortion camp, which calls itself ‘pro-choice’ defends the decision by claiming that it is a woman’s choice and a crucial woman’s right. The anti-abortion camp, which calls itself ‘pro-life’ opposes the decision saying it is taking the life of a child and that it is immoral.\nRegardless of anyone’s views, this decision will shape US politics for years to come."
 NNE.3.d:0 "The DDR has announced that it will be constructing the Palace of the Republic. The Palace will be built in East Berlin to seat the parliament of the German Democratic Republic. The Palace is planned to be constructed on the site of the former Berliner Stadtschloss in the square. The Palace of the Republic will serve as both a cultural and political testament to the German Democratic Republic.\nThe Berliner Stadtschloss was destroyed during WWII and was never repaired or replaced. Shortages in finance and a bureaucratic deadlock resulting from massive political changes prevented it from being rebuilt."
 NNE.4.d:0 "In a landmark case, Carey v Population Services International has officially ruled that it is unconstitutional to prohibit anyone other than a licensed pharmacist to distribute nonprescription contraceptives to persons 16 years of age or over. Additionally, Carey v Population Services International also ruled that individuals under the age of 16 cannot be denied contraceptives by anyone. The Court held that the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment does not allow a state to intrude on an individual’s decisions on matters of procreation. The primary appellee, PSI, is a nonprofit corporation to provide knowledge about birth control and provide birth control services. The secondary appellees are Reverend James Haden who led a program to give out nonprescription contraceptives, Physicians who specialize in birth control, and a resident of New York who wants to distribute contraceptives to his children."
 NNE.5.d:0 "In a landmark case, Planned Parenthood v Casey has officially ruled that states can pass laws regulating abortion past the third trimester. In Casey, plaintiffs challenged 5 of the provisions of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982:\nInformed Consent; the doctor must provide specific information 24 hours before the procedure including health and viability\nSpousal Notice; a woman seeking abortion must notify the father\nParental Consent; minors have to have consent from the parents\nMedical Emergency; in which termination of pregnancy is immediately necessary to avert the death of the mother\nReporting Requirements; Certain reporting and record keeping mandates on facilities providing abortions"
 NNE.6.d:0 "In a landmark case, Abington School District v Schempp has officially ruled that school-sponsored bible reading in public schools is unconstitutional. The school district argued that the bible is a part of their curriculum and Schempp argued that it violated secularity and the freedom of religion. After a long hearing and gradual escalation, the case reached the Supreme Court. Pennsylvania’s statute compelling school districts to perform Bible readings was overturned in the process. The issue has many different individuals divided and bringing arguments in favor and in opposition to the ruling."
 NNE.7.d:0 "The DDR's main airline, Deutsch Lufthansa, has officially been terminated for failing to meet profit quotas. Commentators however say that this was due to an imminent suit against the DDR airline for use of the Lufthansa name. All Deutsch Lufthansa assets have been given to another DDR airline, Interflug"
 NNE.8.d:0 "The Berlin Palace’s demolition has been announced today by the German Democratic Republic. The Palace has been declared a symbol of Prussian militarism and will be destroyed as a result. The demolition will proceed quickly and will begin within’ a few weeks. Walter Ulbricht, General Secretary of the Central Committee, is declaring that the Palace’s cultural symbolism and testament are an affront to the workers of the People’s Republic and to Socialism as a whole.\nThere are objections coming from people within’ the GDR and outside of it who believe the Palace to be a cultural and historical monument that means far more, if at all, than militarism.\nThe process is estimated to take 3-5 months and 19 tons of dynamite."
 NNE.9.d:0 "Lhamo Dhondrub, now known as Tenzin Gyatso, has been proclaimed as the 14th Dalai Lama. Officially declared the Dalai Lama in 1940, Tenzin Gyatso has officially assumed his full duties at the age of 15.\nIn the late 1930s, Reting Rinpoche had a vision that led him to the home of the Dalai Lama’s incarnation, Lhamo Dhondup. Sera Lama reported that Lhamo Dhondup held an old rosary that belonged to the 13th Dalai Lama and the boy recognized Sera Lama immediately. Lhamo Dhondup also referred to Sera Lama in the dialect of the 13th Dalai Lama which his biological mother could not recognize. Additionally, the boy was presented with a series of tests. He was presented with a series of possessions, some of which belonged to the Dalai Lama and others that did not. Lhamo Dhondup only chose the possessions that had belonged to the 13th Dalai Lama.\nThe assumption of duty will have major implications for Buddhists around the world and the political region in general. The decisions and teachings of the 14th Dalai Lama will pave the political landscape for years to come."
 NNE.10.d:0 "Alger Hiss, an American government official, has been accused of being a Soviet spy and is being convicted. The evidence against Alger Hiss includes a claim by Whittaker Chambers, a former US Communist Party Member, that Alger Hiss was a communist. Hiss filed a defamation suit against Chambers. However, Chambers also produced new evidence that both he and Hiss were involved in espionage. The court will proceed in light of this evidence and include perjury as some of the evidence conflicts with claims that Alger Hiss had made previously. The trial has brought up new discussions regarding the extent of Soviet espionage in the United States."
 NNE.11.d:0 "A tragic plane crash in Sverdlosk has cost the lives of 19 people and the entire VVS Moscow ice hockey team. The plane, en route to a match, crashed as a result of poor weather. A heavy snowstorm coupled with strong winds blew the plane into a tailspin, crashing it into the ground. Only 2 of the team survived. Bobrov overslept and Shuvalov was injured.\nIn memory of the dead, a memorial is being erected near the common grave in Koltsovo. Many of the team’s fans are now in morning over the loss.\nVasiliy Stalin, Joseph Stalin’s son and patron of the team, is now attempting to recruit a new team and expects to have everyone recruited within’ a day in time for the big game." 
 NNE.12.d:0 "Senator Kefauver has begun hearings on organized crime, a major problem according to United States articles of 1949. Kefauver has already said he plans to interview over five hundred people on the topic of organized crime. Kefauver has publicly stated that he believes that a large Sicilian organization based on family ties operates a large mafia throughout the United States. The Committee plans to nationally broadcast these hearings to the entire country. Regardless of whether Kefauver's prediction is correct, this will go a long way to help understand and destroy the problem of organized crime in the United States."
 NNE.13.d:0 "A massive, magnitude 8.6 earthquake has struck the region of Assam-Tibet. More than 1,526 people were killed and 30000 were injured and massive amounts of property damage were reported. The earthquake has been traced back to 2 continental plates converging. Geological field studies from around the globe are being sent to the site of the earthquake to study it and humanitarian aid is arriving around the world to help. However, in a shocking development, there are hundreds of ‘disaster tourists’ who are arriving to see the destruction but do not intend to aid. Unlike the scientists who are avoiding travelling in paths that obstruct humanitarian efforts, the disaster tourist vehicles are blocking infrastructure and caused minor setbacks. Despite this, relief efforts will progress nominally."
 NNE.14.d:0 "Pope Pius XII has promulgated Humani Generis, the latest Papal Encyclical. The Encyclical seeks to address many opinions that the Pope believes are threatening to undermine the foundations of Catholic Doctrine. It addresses the role of theology, obstacles to finding God, issues the Pope has with modern culture, several theological developments involving the Catholic Church after WWII, and polygenism. Additionally, the Encyclical takes a nuanced position with evolution and states that human sciences are not in conflict with biblical teachings. The position on evolution has many theologians reconsidering their positions and many religious individuals leaving the Young Earth theory behind."
 NNE.15.d:0 "The US federal government is conducting a long series of prosecutions against the Communist Party of the United States. The group has been charged with the violation of the Smith Act, a statute that imposes penalties on people for advocating the violent overthrow of the government. The defendants are countering by stating that they want a peaceful transition and that no matter what, the Freedom of Speech protects their views and statements. CPUSA’s statements have sparked a national debate over the Freedom of Speech which has drawn people around the country to argue in favor of CPUSA’s right regardless of their own personal affiliations or feelings about communism."
 NNE.16.d:0 "After 4 months and 19 tons of dynamite, the Berlin Palace has been officially demolished despite objections. The foundation was so solid that the entire mount of the building remained intact even when it fell onto the ground. The only section that has not been demolished is a portal from the balcony where Karl Liebknecht had declared the GDR. Construction for a new building, the Council of the State, is being planned on the former building’s site. Planning and funding have already been finished and secured respectively. The portal from the balcony will be included in the new building as it is considered important to the GDR and its culture.\nA majority of the artifacts inside will be preserved in storage, to a minor relief to people who believe the building to be culturally important."
 NNE.17.d:0 "Julius and Ethel Rodenberg are on trial for espionage today. The two individuals and their co-conspirators have been convicted and have a large base of evidence against them. Evidence has been found that they provided top-secret information about radar, sonar, and jet propulsion engines to the USSR. Additionally, evidence was found that they were transmitting top secret nuclear weapons data to the USSR, which is known to now be in the hands of the Soviet Union.\nThe implications of transmitting nuclear weapons data to the Soviets are severe. Up until now, the only country that has nuclear weapons is the US. However, with the loss of this data, the Soviet Union will be able to begin construction of its own nuclear weapons and pose a threat to the western powers.\nThe shakedown for other spies who were involved is underway and the country’s nuclear research facilities are under lockdown until the shakedown is complete."
 NNE.18.d:0 "In a landmark case, Dennis v United States has ruled that Dennis, the General Secretary of CPUSA, does not have protection under the 1st amendment if the exercise involves the creation of a plot to overthrow the government. The trial found Dennis guilty of conspiring to overthrow the government and must be punished under the Smith Act. Dennis previously claimed that there was no plot and that he advocated a peaceful transition to socialism. Ten other CPUSA members were also found convicted of advocating the violent overthrow of the government. The trial reached the supreme court and it was ruled six to two in favor of punishing Dennis and the other conspirators. The conspiring CPUSA members have been sentenced to 5 years in prison with a $10000 fine each."
 NNE.19.d:0 "The floods which have hit the North Sea’s coastline this winter has had devastating results for the people of The Netherlands, Britain, and Belgium. Water Dykes proved unable to hold back the swelling tides, flooding the coasts with unprecedented fury. The Netherlands has been hit the worst, suffering near catastrophic damage as over 9% of arable land has been ruined with an estimated 1,800 lives being lost. The province of Zeeland remains in a state of disarray as severe flood damage makes transportation and rescue efforts arduous until water levels drop. Damage in Southern England and Scotland has been substantial as well, with an estimated 300 people dying due to the floods. Belgium has also taken damage to its coast, though on a much smaller scale then in comparison to its neighbors."
 NNE.20.d:0 "The New York Giants have won the National League!\nBobby Thomson, the outfielder and third baseman for the Giants struck a game-running home run for the team off of Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Ralph Branca. In the final inning, Thomson struct a three-run homer winning the game against the Dodgers.\nThis is a historical moment for the country as the game is the first ever televised nationally and is seen by millions of viewers with millions more hearing it on radio. The game winning strike is officially being declared the “shot heard ‘round the world”, after the gunshot that started the Revolutionary War in 1776, because it is being broadcasted to so many Americans including overseas servicemembers."
 NNE.22.d:0 "A series of magazine articles titled “Man Will Conquer Space Soon” has been published in Collier’s Magazine. The articles detail Wernher von Braun’s plans for manned spaceflight. The articles have sparked a massive national interest in space travel and futuristic optimism. The articles feature detailed drawings, paintings, and illustrations created by the magazine’s design team and stun readers with their vivid imaginings of life in space. Already the country is discussing the implications of space travel and colonization and what the world can do if it pursues these technologies."
 NNE.23.d:0 "A massive strike has been organized by the United Steelworkers of America against 10 major steelmakers in the US but was stopped as President Harry S Truman nationalized the American steel industry before the walkout and gave the workers a wage increase. The steel companies who lost control of their facilities are now suing the government to regain their properties. If the President wins the case, albeit unlikely, then it could have serious implications regarding the authority of the government’s ability to nationalize industry.\nSenator Joseph McCarthy is officially denouncing the president for permitting known communists to remain in employment."
 NNE.24.d:0 "In a landmark decision, Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co v Sawyer has ruled that the president does not have the authority to nationalize industries and the steel facilities must be returned to their private owners. The supreme court declared that without authority conferred on him by Congress, the president is not allowed to seize government control over private property. The court voted six to three in favor of Youngstown Sheet & tube Co. The facilities are being immediately handed over to their former private owners but no damages are being paid from the loss of profit in the time that the facilities were under government control."
 NNE.26.d:0 " In the southern San Joaquin Valley, a 7.3 magnitude earthquake has caused 2.6 million dollars of damage and at least 11 killed in the town of Tehachapi. Two railroad tunnels collapsed and the town of Bakersfield was also affected. Pipelines were damaged by aftershocks to the event as well. Cotton growing near the earthquake was also offset. Beno Gutenberg, the director of the Caltech Seismological Lab, was surprised by the shock. He said: 'There is no doubt that yesterday's quake is the largest Southern California has had in this century.' The American Red Cross has declared the earthquake a major disaster with around 700 families affected, however access to the area has been impeded by landslides."
 NNE.27.d:0 "The Republic of China in Taiwan and Japan have finally declared peace. The delay in peace negotiations was due to neither Chinese governments attending the Treaty of San Francisco because of the Chinese Civil War. The United States is said to have exerted major pressure over Japan in order to make them sign a peace conference. The text of the Treaty is similar to the Treaty of Francisco's but it has been edited to fit the Republic of China. The Treaty does not mention who the true owner of Taiwan should be, and instead primarily deals with Japanese claims and nationals."
 NNE.28.d:0 "Thirteen Jews have been executed in Lubyanka Prison, Moscow. After being arrested since June 1949, the entire defendants were accused of undermining the Soviet Union. Their trial is an indicator of Stalin now turning against the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee which had helped Jewish culture rebuild after the Holocaust. Five Yiddish writers were also killed as part of the thirteen. One victim, Solomon Bregman, fell unconscious when the death sentence was passed and has not waken yet. Lina Stern, also convicted, was not executed due to her scientific work. Most unusually, there were no prosecutors or defense attorneys, simply three military judges who asked random questions."
 NNE.29.d:0 "Jonas Solk, an American medical researcher, has announced on CBS he has created a vaccine against the debilitating disease poliomyelitis. Solk took the approach of Maurice Brodie, which was to kill strains of polio and inject them into a person. Solk says he is writing an article for the American Medical Association that will be published soon. This is a major breakthrough in polio treatment, as it is now less susceptible to younger people who are particularly affected by it."
 NNE.30.d:0 "Dag Hammarskjold has been appointed the second United Nations Secretary-General as a mostly unbiased candidate. He has never been aligned with a political party despite his service in the Swedish Government, especially its diplomatic corps. He was unanimously appointed Secretary-General, and he will continue to reign for five years until 1958. "
 adlai_civil.2.d:0 "Many conservative southern voters split from the Democrat Party in 1948 to form the Dixiecrat Party, however they performed poorly in the 1948 elections and many returned to the Democrats, causing the end of the Dixiecrats. Following the election of President Adlai Stevenson, many former Dixiecrats have been emboldened by the president’s pro-segregationist policies and their influence within the party has grown rapidly. Throughout his term, more vocal Dixiecrats have openly advocated for the president to take further steps to protect southern traditions, and make sure Jim Crow laws are upheld in the south. Recently, pressure on the President from Dixiecrats within the party have intensified, causing many internal issues for the President and pressuring him into action. In response to this pressure, President Adlai has announced before congress his intention to uphold Jim Crow laws in the southern states. This move immediately prompted protests amongst civil rights supporters and many have voiced concerns over the implications of this on the treatment of African-Americans in the south. With the president bowing to Dixiecrat interests, it seems the desegregation movement has suffered a major setback."
 iraqi_intifada.1.d:0 "The Iraqi Intifada as it has been coined is an ongoing series of violent protests and national strikes against the Hashemite Monarchy and the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty signed 4 years back. Starting with port workers in Basara, these revolutionaries wish to force Faisal the II of Iraq to abdicate and to transform Iraq into a fully independent republic, separate of British control with their hope being to control their own foreign affairs.

 black_saturday.1.d:0 "Following the death of 50 Egyptian policemen in the city of Ismailia at the hands of British soldiers, rebellion erupted all throughout Cairo. Beginning with a strike against British airplanes in Almaza Airport, the riot spread through the city. Policemen, students, and protestors marched to the Prime Minister's office to demand war with the United Kingdom. After being told Farouk I was denying the state of war, the mob moved to Abdeen Palace. Many British and Western institutions were burnt down, along with nightclubs frequented by the King. A total of 3.4 million pounds were lost in the looting and rioting that occurred.  The Egyptian Army managed to arrive before sunset and quell the riots."
 conquest.100.d:0 "The Republic of Korea is now at the brink of collapse as its capital, Seoul, has just been successfully invaded by advancing North Korean troops. North Korea, utilizing tactics similar to Blitzkrieg, have used their Soviet made tanks to forcefully advance themselves towards Seoul, with heavy casualties left for the South Koreans since they lack any sort of anti-tank weaponry or tanks at all. The North Koreans, in an effort to starve the enemy, have blown up the bridge within the Han River, trapping thousands of soldiers and civilians who desperately need evacuation and medical attention. This event in the Korean War shows the weakness of  the American-backed South Korea, and observers speculate that if this trend continues, capitulation is expected to happen within months."
 conquest.101.d:0 " Hope for Democracy and Civil Liberties in the Korean Peninsula have once more been ignited, as the UN Coalition composed of the United States and her allies have managed to retake Seoul from the KPA stationed to garrison and occupy the city. The victory however wasn’t easy, as the KPA have set up defensive fortifications at nearly every corner of the city, with barricades and anti-tank weaponry riddled all over Seoul. Nevertheless, the coalition force was able to pierce through every resistance the KPA placed on them, and have finally retaken Seoul for South Korea. This victory will send a clear message to Pyongyang that the fight for the Korean Peninsula will soon come to their shores, and their land tainted with blood and despair."
 conquest.102.d:0 "The tides have shifted in the Korean Peninsula, for the intervention of the People’s Republic of China has brought about the fall of Seoul once more, reclaiming it from the UN coalition forces. The coalition, surprised and exhausted from the battle, have undergone a mandatory evacuation from the Seoul Metropolitan Area towards other cities in the South, but are demoralized and are incapable of fighting at this time. This defeat will play a critical role in deciding the fate of the Korean Peninsula, and so far observers believe that the coalition of China and North Korea will most likely win. However, those same observers have doubts on their predictions, since numerous reports indicate that the Chinese forces are exhausted and overwhelmed by the war, and it will take time and effort to regain their strength, which may open an opportunity for a counterattack by UN coalition forces."
 conquest.103.d:0 "In the light of defeat after defeat, the UN coalition forces have devised an operation that will break both the Chinese and North Korean forces. The operation is called “Operation Ripper”, an artillery bombardment throughout the Seoul Metropolitan Area followed by a siege of the area. The artillery bombardment is designed to inflict maximum damage towards the Sino-North Korean coalition, while minimizing casualties on the UN coalition. According to our sources on the ground, it is a great success, with casualties in the tens of thousands for Chinese and the North Koreans, with half of the Seoul Metropolitan Area under UN control. Observers believe that since the war has ravaged so long, the UN will press for an armistice agreement to end the conflicts in the peninsula once and for all."
 conquest.104.d:0 "The capitulation of the Republic of Korea is coming sooner than expected, as North Korea was able to break the Pusan perimeter, the only line of defense for South Korea and its only major city left, as the rest have been occupied by North Korea. As of writing, the remainder of the UN coalition forces are evacuating to the island of Jeju, the only island that hasn’t been touched by North Korean forces. However, seeing this, North Korea have initiated efforts in placing long range artillery that is able to target Jeju island, so observers are expecting mass casualties for the inhabitants of the island. With Pusan gone, it is expected that North Korea will claim the entirety of the peninsula and South Korea will merely be reduced to a government-in-exile similar to the governments of nations occupied by the Nazis in WW2."
 conquest.105.d:0 "The days of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea are numbered, as the UN coalition forces have successfully invaded and occupied Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. In the midst of the chaos and confusion, some of North Korea’s elites and prominent government officials were able to evacuate the capital, while some were unlucky and their fate in the hands of the UN coalition forces, with Kim Il-Sung included in those who evacuated. This is a clear victory for the UN coalition, as they have finally pushed back the North Koreans towards the mountain ranges, ensuring capitulation within months. However, observers point out that should an outside force intervene in the crisis, such as the Soviet Union or the People’s Republic of China, the said victory is temporary and will be catastrophic in the near future."
