 air_disaster.1.d:0 "Late last night, a Korean Airlines Flight from Ted Stevens International Airport in Anchorage, Alaska bound for Gimpo International Airport in Seoul, South Korea strayed into Soviet airspace at 15:51 UTC over the Kamchatka peninsula and was shot down following the failure of the aircraft to react to warning signs and communications from the Soviet military. A Soviet Sukhoi SU-15 shot down the civilian airliner, with the Georgian Congressman, Larry McDonald, on board. All 269 passengers onboard have perished."
 air_disaster.2.d:0 "Earlier this afternoon, an El Al Flight from Vienna's Wien-Schwechat International Airport bound for Tel Aviv's Lod Airport was shot down over the People’s Republic of Bulgaria due to deviating from its planned course. The cause of this deviation is unknown at the moment. It has been established that the flight, flying at Fl180, left the Amber 10 airway and strayed 200 miles into Bulgarian territory. The aircraft had ignored warning shells fired off by MiG-15s which had been stationed to defend Sofia. Pinchas Ben-Porat, the man who led to the formation of the Israeli Air Force, the IAF’s 101st Squadron, and El Al died on board."
 air_disaster.3.d:0 "Tragedy struck this afternoon at the  Llandow aerodrome as an Avro Tudor V named 'Star Girl' crashed after attempting to land at the Llandow aerodrome, eyewitnesses said that the aircraft approached the runway at an abnormal low altitude with it’s undercarriage down. Only 3 people survived this crash while 8 had made it to hospital but died due to their wounds. As it stands this is the most deadly air incident in Wales. "
 air_disaster.4.d:0 "A grave loss of life has occured at the Los Rodeos Airport today. Two 747s, one from KLM and one from Pan American, crashed in the fog while attempting to depart. After being diverted due to a terrorist attack at Gran Canaria Airport, the congestion at Los Rodeos led to the accident where 583 souls lost their lives. 61 people survived the incident, and they were all seated on the Pan American aircraft. This has become the most deadly air incident in the world."
 air_disaster.5.d:0 "A tragedy struck the world of Rock and Roll. During the Winter Dance Party Tour of Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and J. P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson, their chartered V-Tail Bonanza from Beechcraft disappeared into the snow surrounding Mason City Municipal Airport and was soon found smoldering in a cornfield at 9:35 AM less than six miles from the airport. This day, Feburary 3rd, 1959, will be as some say, The Day the Music Died."
 air_disaster.6.d:0 "\nFollowing the crash of an American Airlines DC-10 at O’Hare International Airport the Federal Aviation Administration under chief Langhorne Bond said that tonight, on July 6th, 1979 that all U.S based DC-10s which number up to 138 and also all DC-10s from countries with bilateral agreements with the U.S would be grounded. All DC-10s are also banned from flying in U.S airspace except for foreign carriers returning their DC-10s to their maintenance bases."
 adlai_civil.1.d:0 "On May 7th the Supreme Court of the United States handed down the landmark Brown vs Board case. In a unanimous vote by all 9 court members, they agreed that educating races separately was unconstitutional, thereby overwriting the Plessy v Ferguson case from 1897 which held up segregation laws. The case began with a class-action lawsuit filed against the Board of Education by the city of Topeka in Kansas, represented by Oliver Brown, and soon came under review by the Supreme Court. Their decision caused great unrest in the south, being seen as a threat to their traditional order. In a shocking move by President Adlai Stevenson, he has refused to enforce the act and stated that he intends to allow any schools that wish to retain educational segregation to do so. This decision has prompted great outrage from Liberal elements within the Democratic Party and there are scattered calls for the impeachment of the President. However, it seems unlikely any of these calls will come to fruition, and the South’s position as well as that of the segregationist movement has been greatly strengthened."

 farouk_gang.1.d:0 "King Farouk has announced today that all red cars in Egypt are banned effective immediately and only he is allowed to own any. King Farouk has been known to only drive red cars and has a large fleet of them. Much of King Farouk’s loyalists have praised the law stating that the King should be the only one who is worthy to use such vehicles. Anonymous opponents have criticized the law as “absolutely insane” and “completely meaningless”. Several individuals have come to the anonymous interview simply to state that King Farouk shot out their tires when passing them on the road and accused him of jealousy over others’ red cars."
 farouk_gang.2.d:0 "Princess Fathia has been banned from Egypt after an affair with Riyad Ghali. Recently, it has become public note that Riyad Ghali, royal advisor to the King of Egypt, has proposed to Princess Fathia of Egypt. Despite strong objections from King Farouk, the marriage proceeded at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco. It was also brought to light that both of them have converted to Catholicism and plan to live together. In response, King Farouk has announced that Princess Fathia are banned from Egypt and excommunicated. All of their possessions still in Egypt have been confiscated by the state."
 farouk_gang.3.d:0 "Queen Narriman returned to Egypt and filed for a divorce after her husband cheated on her in France by sleeping with many women including the Swedish movie star Brigitta Stenberg. King Farouk, after voyaging to France, has spent his years since the exile partying in nightclubs, gambling in casinos, and drinking heavily. Different people have had varying experiences with him. Many of the women he slept with loved him but he was notorious for offending others with his hubris. This behavior even caused him to be banned from some establishments in his time in France. People have loved him, and people have hated him. Farouk has left a distinct touch on the French nightlife in his visit no matter what others think of him."
 free_officer_fail.1.d:0 "After sieging King Farouk’s palace, the Free Officers decided to mount an attack. They were up against approximately 800 well-rested and well equipped Sudanese guardsmen who were loyal to the king. In the evening, the Free Officers began an assault against King Farouk. King Farouk, who was an expert marksman, also participated in the fight killing approximately 16 attackers who were attempting to cross the Palace grounds. The Free Officers, desperate to maintain the offensive and kill the King, decided against a withdrawal. Unable to pierce the fortified palace and being constantly harassed by the King himself from a distance, the Free Officers sustained extreme casualties. After the attack, King Farouk immediately ordered a counter-attack against the now disorganized and severely wounded Free Officer siege camp. Poorly defended, all of the Free Officers with the exception of Nasser, were killed. Approximately 30 of the remaining seigers surrendered but King Farouk executed them personally because he would not tolerate treason. Our noble King Farouk today has declared a state of emergency. There is now a manhunt underway to find the traitorous Nasser and bring him to justice. Additionally, the King has called on all patriotic Egyptians to enlist in the army as he is beginning a large buildup to maintain security in the region."
 nasser_execution.1.d:0 "The hunt for Nasser has finally come to a close. After a long and arduous manhunt, Egyptian police found the traitorous Nasser held up in a cell inside of Cairo. After establishing a blockade, the Sudanese guard was called in to arrest Nasser and kill the defenders of the building. Nasser was brought before King Farouk where he stood a fair and just trial for his crimes. It was ultimately decided that his crime must be capitally punished and was executed by strangulation personally by King Farouk."
 sudan_part.1.d:0 "The fight against British rule had the Sudanese region embroiled in a terrible conflict. Our noble King Farouk desiring to maintain order and peace, established a peacekeeping mission. Not wanting to contribute to the conflict, Egyptian forces built garrisons and administrative headquarters to ensure order. After 4 years, the conflict has finally come to an end with the British colonial garrison withdrawing and Sudanese forces almost depleted. Because the only remaining organized Sudanese force remains in the south, King Farouk has established control over the anarchic Sudanese region. The South Sudanese government has sent a formal protest to the King over this, but King Farouk responded stating they were in no condition to govern the ravaged north. King Farouk has openly admitted to the Egyptian people that he is not sure South Sudan is even a functional government in its current state. He is currently considering sending peacekeepers to the South to establish order there, too."
 farouk_exiled.1.d:0 "On the morning of the 26th of July, and after heavy fighting in the Alexandrian palace of King Farouk, the Free Officers issued an ultimatum to King Farouk to abdicate and go into exile. Farouk agreed, seeing attempting to defend as hopeless. In the evening, Farouk left Egypt from his yacht El Mahrousa and set sail for Naples. Farouk eventually would live out the remainder of his days in Monaco. Immediately after Farouk left Egypt, his son, Ahmed Faud, was proclaimed the new king of Egypt. The British government has yet to appoint a new Regent Prime Minister. Currently all of Farouk’s possessions are up for auction and the revolutionary government is inviting everyone who can afford to buy in a chance to purchase some of Farouk’s treasures in Alexandria."
