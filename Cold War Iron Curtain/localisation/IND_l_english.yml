The People’s Republic of India has claimed victory in their revolutionary war against the Republic of India. The PRI leadership has said they have liberated the country from the princes and corrupt Republican Indian leaders that took from rightful commoners. The last of Republic of India forces and people have crossed into neighboring Pakistan or Burma and also left to Ceylon. NATO has called this a failure and a setback in the South Asia region. Cominform is calling this a success for opening up the doors to South Asia and the Middle East for liberation and revolution. The fighting has ended in India, but the exiled Indians have claimed that the fight is not over."
