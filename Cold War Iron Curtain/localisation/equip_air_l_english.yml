However, after 5 aircraft had been built the program was cancelled. The Soviet Air Force had cancelled the plane because their doctrine had shifted from close air support to tactical nuclear weapon usage. The Il-40 never saw combat and only served with the USSR."

 KOR_mr_stealth_fighter_equipment_1_desc: "The F-35A is the conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) variant of Lockheed Martin's F-35 Lightning II family. The F-35 program began development in 1992, with the A variant taking to the skies in late 2006 and dropping its first bombs less than six years later. The A variant is the smallest and lightest variant of F-35 and is primarily intended to replace the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The Republic of Korea was one of many allied nations to purchase F-35s."

The MiG-15 was involved in many conflicts since its introduction in the Korean War, where it proved a worthy adversary to the American F-86 Sabre and F9F Panther. A section of the Korean-Chinese border was nicknamed “MiG Alley” because of their prevalence in the area. Over 18 000 MiG-15s were built and used by many nations, most notably the USSR and Eastern Bloc nations.

However, the MiG-17 primarily saw use in the Vietnam war with the NVAF and PLAAF were it scored 28 aerial victories. The MiG-17 was so successful that it even held its own against the much more modern, supersonic American Phantom II fighters of the Vietnam war. The MiG-17 was generally decommissioned in the 1970’s, while it still remains in limited service in some African nations and North Korea."

The aircraft saw extensive service with 37 nations and has been involved in numerous conflicts such as the Soviet-Afghan War, Iran-Iraq war, Operation Iraqi Freedom, 2011 Libyan conflict and more.

The nation also anticipated considerable exports sales of the type. During 1991, the entire programme was halted due to a lack of available finance just prior to the commencement of production and a year prior to the scheduled date of the type's envisioned maiden flight.
