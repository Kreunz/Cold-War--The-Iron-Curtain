 free_officer.2.d:0 "Armed gunmen would begin to patrol the streets of Baghdad as confused civilians watched on with awe. A broadcast would encompass the nation declaring the end of the Hashemite Dynasty, as reports quickly revealed that King Faisal II and The Royal Family were shot at gunpoint while attempting to leave the imperial palace by rogue elements of the military known as the Free Officers. As of now, a revolutionary council comprised of the orchestrators of the coup lead the nation. The new government have quickly announced their ambitions of an Arab Socialist Republic, allying themselves with the likes of Gamal Abdel Nasser. Massive unrest has broken out across the nation already as Iraq transitions."
 free_officer.3.d:0 "On July 14th, the core of Iraq was shaken as rogue elements of the military occupied sections of Baghdad. What first appeared to be an overwhelming success for the free officers would turn into a nightmare as King Faisal II was not willing to accept defeat. Loyalist forces would defend the Imperial palace and major telecommunication stations for three days until the coup would collapse in on itself, unable to gain the momentum to bring down the Dynasty. By July 18th, remaining resistance was squashed and Faisal II made a public declaration to the nation declaring victory. The coup has only strengthened the Hashemites, as opposition have been arrested in droves due to connection to the free officers. The attack has proven that many of the Middle East’s monarchs are here to stay." 
 free_officer.4.d:0 "Following the success of the 14 June Coup, Jordan would quickly announce its removal from the federation declaring full independence. The new government of Iraq would come to accept this and quickly opened up diplomatic and economic ties. Without resistance from its Northern neighbor, Jordan appears to be set on a new path into the approaching decade."
