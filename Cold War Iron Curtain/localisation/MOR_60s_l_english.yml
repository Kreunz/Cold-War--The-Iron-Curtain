 morrocco.1.d:0 "Marking a sad day in the annals of the Alawite Dynasty, Today, Sultan Mohammed The Fifth, Peace Upon Him, has passed,complications of his ongoing surgery becoming too difficult for him to bear; giving way to his elderst son, Hassan II, to now rise up to the Moroccan Throne. Thousands lined up on the doors of the Royal Palace, awaiting impatiently for the King's body to be taken to his grave, to the ballads echoing and the smell of incense that mark the end of an era. The memory of independence seems to have never been so fresh.And whispers of assassination spread like wildfire."

 morrocco.4.d:0 "Media has reported a close attempt on the life of Crown Prince Hassan II while making a speech at the city of Rabat this afternoon. While discussing ties with the West, two men from the crowd threw three Molotov cocktails at the prince and his security. The first Molotov missed entirely, giving alertness to the two coming. One hit security while the third never even was thrown as the crowd quickly swarmed the men. Hassan II finished his speech before quickly being escorted to safety."

While discussing ties with the West, two men from the crowd threw three Molotov cocktails at the prince and his security. The first Molotov missed entirely, giving alertness to the two coming. One hit security while the third never even was thrown as the crowd quickly swarmed the men. Hassan II finished his speech before quickly being escorted to safety. The two men and three other accomplishes have been found and arrested.\n Crown Prince Hassan II was quick to thank the guards and his supporters in the crowd for saving his life, promising that this will not stop future events. What could of ended in a horrific murder left none injured and opposition of the regime weakening in influence."
 morocco_news.1.d.alt:0 "Devastating news of the prince’s death that has spread across Morocco has been officially confirmed by state authorities this evening. Due to his father’s declining health, Crown Prince Hassan II began to take up many of his father’s roles by the end of the decade, leading to him making more public appearances. One such appearance in the city of Rabat would be his last as he addressed the nation on improving relations with the United States and the West. After calling for friendly ties with Israel, three Molotov cocktails would be thrown into Hassan II and his security. Frontline guards would be shocked by the first Molotov, giving a gap for a second to hit Hassan directly on the head, following a third on the chest. The Prince would ignite on fire and collapse, hitting his head during the fall. He would quickly be extinguished and rushed for medical treatment as marshal law was enforced over the frenzied city. Five suspected terrorists were captured within the first hour.\n With Hassan II confirmed dead, the fate of Morocco is at a crossroads. As the current king grows ill, the need for a replacement heir has grown urgent. Next in line for succession is Hassan II’s brother Prince Moulay Abdallah, who has shown little interest in politics. Without the strong Hassan II as a replacement for Mohammad V, this may signal a grave future for the Alaouite Dynasty."

 casablanca.1.d:0 "In the sprawling port city of Casablanca within the arid deserts of Morocco, the leaders of various North African nations, such as Algeria, Egypt, Ghana, Morocco, and others have decided to end their conflict and animosity between their nations and create the \"Casablanca Group\". Formed as an informal association of African nations, its sole purpose was to unite Africa under one banner, with Pan-Africanism a core tenant in its values for a new, united Africa. While the Casablanca Group is widely seen as a benevolent organization, critics point out that the organization is mostly comprising of radical, left wing leaders and their respective political parties, with viewpoints that are critical to Western rule in Africa. Nevertheless, observers believe that the organization may bring about lasting peace and prosperity in one of the most violent, most impoverished continents on the planet, but it is too early to be certain."

After tense dealings with the police, they have been taken into custody of the law where further interrogation has begun. Upon a criminal investigation, four out of the five suspects had concrete evidence against them along with viable connection to the National Union of Popular Forces Party(UNFP) through a contract found in one of the men’s apartment supposedly from Fqih Basri, commanding the attack.\nThis evidence has shocked the government, unsure of how to mount a response. Decisions have been left up to the Crown Prince Hassan II who has made no decision as of now. "
