 ita.202.d:0 "San Marco 1 was launched on December 15, 1964 by an Italian ground crew using an American Scout rocket from Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. It is the first Italian satellite and a great achievement for Edoardo Amaldi and his team. Because of their devotion and hard work, Italy became the fifth country to have its own artificial object in Earth's orbit. The main goal of the mission is to conduct ionospheric research. After 272 days of service, San Marco will burn while re-entering Earth's atmosphere."
