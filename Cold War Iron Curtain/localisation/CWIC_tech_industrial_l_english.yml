However, polymer semiconductors can form far stronger and more flexible basises for electronics and are also much less expensive and lightweight. They are made of complex delicately assembled polymers arranged in a way that allows for electric properties to arise instead of a single non-electric polymer. These conductors are also more efficient and as such, reduce overall power consumption in devices that use them."
 
 
 #Materials 
 materials_I:0 "Titanium Alloys"
 materials_I_desc:0 "Titanium Alloys are metallurgical mixtures of titanium and other allows. They have high tensile strengths and extreme corrosive and weather resistance. Titanium in itself, although strong, is a brittle metal. With the addition of other metals, such as vanadium or aluminum, it can retain much of its strength but also gain ductility. Although infeasible for construction or supporting structures, it is used in aircraft, spacecraft, medical devices, in vehicles, and consumer electronics."
 materials_II:0 "Float Glass"
 materials_II_desc:0 "Float glass is a form of glass created by floating molten glass on molten metals such as tin. This gives it uniform thickness. The uniformity makes it better for commercial and industrial uses in optics and most forms of construction. Virtually all glass used in the modern era is float glass because it is inexpensive to make as it is simply soda-lime glass formed on small quantities of molten, cheap metals with low melting points such as tin. Additionally, float glass can be processed further to create reinforced or frosted glass."

 excavation_II:0 "Bucket Wheel Extractors"
 excavation_II_desc:0 "Bucket wheel extractors are pieces of heavy surface mining equipment that add multiple extractor buckets to a wheel that deposit their loads onto a track as they dig. These extractors continuously scoop material as the wheel turns and are able to carve out vertical sections in a pit. They are highly efficient at harvesting or removing loose material.\nTo date, Bucket Wheel Extractors are the heaviest land vehicles ever made."
 excavation_III:0 "Mountain Top Removal Mining"
 excavation_III_desc:0 "Mountaintop Removal Mining is a method of surface mining at the summit or ridge of a mountain. By removing overburden from a summit or ridge, a large enough level space is created that can be mined downward. Over time, more overburden is removed from the edges of the seams to allow deeper pits from the tops of mountains. This method enables the open pit extraction of rich resources that have been brought up by the seismic formation of mountains without needing to create deep shafts in order to mine them."
 excavation_IV:0 "Landfill Reclamation"
 excavation_IV_desc:0 "Landfill reclamation is the process of gathering waste from a waste landfill for the purpose of processing. Recyclable wastes or scrap is gathered then is shipped off to be sorted and extracted for anything valuable. Metallic wastes can be reforged, plastics can be reprocessed, and anything else that has not degraded can potentially be recycled. Additionally, it aerates the landfill which can help with the degradation of whatever is left behind, aiding in the ecological reclamation of the landfill site in the future assuming toxic materials are also separated from the landfill."

 #Management
 management_I:0 "Total Productive Maintenance (TPM)"
 management_I_desc:0 "TPM is the organization and systematization of maintaining production and improving quality. The primary objective of TPM is to ensure that the productivity of an industrial division is maintained through a modest investment into maintenance and improvements. \nIn order to establish a TPM regimen, dedicated maintenance teams are necessary and resources must be regularly invested to enhance the volume of production."
 management_II:0 "Preventive Maintenance" 
 management_II_desc:0 "Preventative maintenance is a core aspect of TPM in which maintenance and inspections are conducted ahead of time before a breakdown occurs. Through systematic inspection, detection, and correction of failures during non-productive hours work is carried out to avoid breakdown or malfunction. The development of PM requires the development of a regime, special maintenance teams and tools, and a training system in order to enable maintainers to detect potential failures or wearing ahead of time."
 management_III_A:0 "Periodic Maintenance"
 management_III_A_desc:0 "Periodic maintenance is a reduction of the TPM regimen scheduled based on the estimated lifespan of machines or parts. Based off of trends, inspections are planned and conducted periodically and is not as extensive as predictive maintenance, as it results in less frequent inspections. Periodic maintenance reduces overall costs, but has less productivity and more common failures due to the less intensive and regular maintenances."
 management_III_B:0 "Predictive Maintenance"
 management_III_B:0 "Predictive maintenance is an expansion of the TPM regimen scheduled based on the condition of equipment. Predictive maintenance is an expansion of inspections conducted regularly on machinery and maintains equipment whenever it shows signs of wear, fatigue, or potential failure. Predictive maintenance is more expensive as it requires an expansion of the TPM regimen, but is more effective at preventing failures and maintaining productivity."

 #Production efficiency
 production_efficiency_I:0 "Powder Coating"
 production_efficiency_I_desc:0 "To prevent rusting and abrasion, powder coating is used to ‘paint’ industrial machines. The powder is applied electrostatically then thermoset to form a protective layer. Industrial powder coatings produce thicker, stronger, smoother coatings than liquid coatings and cures much faster. By developing powder coating, metal equipment and products can be more protected against rusting and abrasion far better than they could be with traditional paints."
 production_efficiency_II:0 "Half-Twist Conveyor Belt"
 production_efficiency_II_desc:0 "The half-twist is a method of creating a mobius (1 surfaced 3d object) conveyor by half-twisting one end. This results in conveyor belts lasting much longer because the entire surface area of the belt is worn continuously instead of one side being used in a nontwisted belt. This prevents accidents, breaks, and reduces the amount of accidents and replacements needed in conveyor belts, making production more streamlined and improving the manufacturing process."
 production_efficiency_III:0 "New Welding Methods"
 production_efficiency_III_desc:0 "Improving welding methods is an important part of manufacturing.

 production_efficiency_VI_desc:0 "Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) is the usage of a information system [IE computer] to control manufacturing. Assisting manufacturing using CAM software greatly aids management, manufacturing, and storage and allows the computer system to quickly adjust itself to fit a multitude of different specifications. The precision of CAM allows for greater flexibility in changing production, higher precision for higher quality products, and reduced waste by only using the required amount of material and even reducing energy consumption."
 production_efficiency_VII:0 "Computer-Integrated Manufacturing"
 production_efficiency_VIII:0 "Advanced Laser Engraving"
 production_efficiency_VIII_desc:0 "Laser engraving is the usage of lasers to mark an object or leave a laser impression. While laser marking and laser engraving have been used before, developing the technology to mark metal objects with serial numbers or data enables better management of logistics and allows for more permanence than paint or powder marking. Additionally, lasers do not wear out as they do not use tool bits that make contact with the engraving surface."
 production_efficiency_IX:0 "Cold Spraying Coating"
 production_efficiency_IX_desc:0 "Cold spraying is a coating method in which supersonic gas jets spray a surface and impact, leading to adhesion on the surface. This method of coating is much faster than previous methods and enables surfaces of products or machine parts to be manufactured quicker and simpler. It also is more energy efficiency and it can also collect and reuse particles that miss as well as improving overall safety in the workplace."
 production_efficiency_X:0 "Basic 3D Printing"
 production_efficiency_X_desc:0 "3D printing is the process by which liquid or powder materials are solidified to form a solid object. This is primarily used industrially to create thermoset polymer models and create plastic objects. This method is more efficient and less wasteful than plastic molding and can be especially useful in creating medical objects such as implants or replacement tooth crowns."
