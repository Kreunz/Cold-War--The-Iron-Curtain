 israel.5.d:0 "Today the State of Israel has officially been introduced into the United Nations, decided upon in an intense vote that resulted in a 37-12 decision, sealing the fragile thing that is the Jewish nation's independence, for now at least. With Israel showing some degree of support for the UN partition plan, it is anyone's guess if peace will be achieved, but no doubt many believe this to be the first step in a series of many. As the Western World begins to establish ties and show their support for the infant state, Israel's Arab neighbors are enraged, still reeling from their previous failure to eliminate Israel. The revived Jewish state has now left its first modern mark on history."
 israel.6.d:0 "Following months of heated negotiations, the Lausanne Conference, convened by the United Nations, has finally come to an end. The issues of the conference mainly concerned the fallout from the 1948 Arab-Israeli War - including borders, the split of Jerusalem and the 700,000 Palestinian refugees created by the conflict. The demarcation line established after the conflict, seeing Israel control 60% of the original partition plan for a Palestinian state, has been maintained despite further Israeli demands and to the outrage of the Arab States. In addition, the Israelis refused to allow any refugees back to their old homes and rejected the ‘100,000 refugees offer’ proposed by the UN. While tensions remain high and Egypt and Jordan still occupy the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, it appears that the fragile peace in the region has been maintained and Israel’s admission to the United Nations should help lead to a peaceful future for the incredibly volatile region."

 israel.8.d:0 "In a historic event for our nation, the very first local elections have been held throughout the country. The system works so that the residents of cities and local councils vote for a mayor, as well as electing members of the local and city councils, with these votes occurring every legislative election. For the first time since the Arab War, Palestinians have been allowed to vote for their local councillors and so far the whole process has gone smoothly, without any significant reports of political violence. With results continuing to trickle in, the people of Israel are finally able to look back upon the constant conflict of the 40’s, for the first time, from a position of relative peace and security."
 israel.7.d:0 "Ever since our victory in the War of Independence the situation on the Syrian border has been tense, with no official peace treaty ever being signed. The United Nations Israel-Syria Mixed Armistice Commission has been working to observe the terms of the armistice and after many months of negotiations an agreement has finally been made. Under the terms of the Israeli-Syrian General Armistice Agreement, Syrian forces have evacuated occupied territories west of the International Border, which have now become demilitarized zones. Syria still officially maintains control of these areas. However, despite the success of the armistice negotiations, many still doubt the possibility of a lasting peace in the region."

 herut_conflict_1_desc:0 "While being less than a decade old, the young State of Israel hasn’t failed in leaving a considerably large mark on the Middle East, fighting the Arab states in a constant war from 1947 to 1949. With the far-right Herut party now in power, carrying the slogan of ‘To the banks of the Jordan River’, many international experts have speculated that renewed conflict is inevitable. Indeed, the Israeli government has today announced that its forces have crossed the ceasefire line and clashed with Jordanian troops in the West Bank. Similarly, the government of Jordan has declared that the Israeli invaders will be driven out at all costs, and has called on the Arab states for support. However, with all their neighbours remaining silent, it appears that the Jordanians are on their own."
 herut_conflict_2_desc:0 "Ever since the shameful armistice of 1949, the so-called Kingdom of Jordan has maintained occupation of our rightful territories on the West Bank. With the highly expansionist Herut now in power, we can finally look towards reclaiming the West Bank and Jerusalem with it. With preparations complete, the first Israeli troops have crossed over the border and early reports indicate that they have clashed with Jordanian forces at strategic positions across the front."
 herut_conflict_3_desc:0 "With our forces engaged in heavy clashes with Jordanian troops in the West Bank, the nation held its breath for more news from the front. However, it appears we greatly underestimated the strength of the Jordanian Army, as our attacking forces were repulsed in heavy fighting across the front. With our forces bruised, the Jordanians launched a bold counterattack which forced our troops back towards the original border. Finally, the last of our battered and bruised forces were able to reach Israeli borders, under heavy bombardment from Jordanian artillery. With our forces defeated, we were faced with no choice but to propose a ceasefire and humiliatingly accept Jordan’s occupation of the West Bank. With our weakness displayed to the world, we must remain vigilant in case the Arabs are emboldened by our defeat and try to strike once more."
 herut_conflict_5_desc:0 "With our forces engaged in heavy clashes with the Jordanian troops in the West Bank, the nation held its breath for more news from the front. After days of attack and counterattack, Jordanian forces finally broke around Jerusalem, triggering the enemy into a retreat across the front, which soon turned into a rout. With our forces in hot pursuit, the battered and bruised Jordanian forces have finished crossing over the Jordan River, and  their government is calling for a ceasefire, agreeing to acknowledge Israeli control over the West Bank. Following our stunning victory, military parades have been held in Jerusalem and celebrations have broken out throughout the country. With a vital strategic position secured, we have sent out a message to the Arab states that Israel is a force to be reckoned with, and increased domestic support for the government to previously unseen levels."
 herut_conflict_6_desc:0 "With Israeli forces heavily engaged with Jordanian troops in the West Bank, reports from the front have been vague and inconsistent, with limited amounts of reliable information. However, in an event coming as a surprise to many, it appears that Israeli forces have been defeated and forced back to their borders, suffering heavy casualties. The Israeli government and the Jordanians have officially signed a ceasefire, with Jordan securing their control of the West Bank. While many experts don’t believe that the Arab states will follow up on the Israeli defeat, their failure has broken the illusion of Israeli military superiority established after the 1948 war, and potentially irreparably damaged the ruling Herut Party’s reputation within the country."
 herut_conflict_7_desc:0 "Following the Herut Party’s rise to power in Israel, they have displayed an increasing level of hostility towards the remaining Arab-held territories in Palestine, namely the Jordanian-held West Bank and Egyptian-held Gaza strip. After months of steadily increasing tensions within the region, reports have flooded the global press of Israeli forces invading the Gaza Strip and engaging in heavy fighting with scattered and unprepared Egyptian units around the city. While many experts predict that the Israeli surprise attack will be able to drive the Egyptians out of Gaza, the Egyptian government has declared its intent to drive the Israelis out of Gaza and force them back to their original positions. With the eyes of the world fixed on Gaza, the international community anxiously awaits the results of this confrontation."
 herut_conflict_8_desc:0 "With our forces engaged in heavy fighting with the Egyptians in Gaza, the people of Israel looked on, anticipating a glorious victory against the Egyptian forces. Indeed, the speed of our advance didn’t allow the enemy to regroup and consolidate their forces, allowing our forces to quickly overrun Gaza and methodically drive them out of the entire Gaza Strip, inflicting heavy casualties in the process. With our troops taking up positions on the border with the Sinai Peninsula, the Egyptian government has agreed to a ceasefire, acknowledging our control of the Gaza Strip. With a city of over 200,000 people now in our hands, this represents a considerable step towards providing for the security of our nation and will send a message to the Arabs that we are not to be underestimated. However, dealing with the majority Palestinian population there may prove to be a considerable challenge in the future."
 herut_conflict_9_desc:0 "With our forces engaged in heavy fighting with the Egyptians in Gaza, the people of Israel looked on, anticipating a glorious victory against the Egyptian forces. However, after initial victories against a disorganised opponent, the Egyptians were able to rally their forces and beat back our attacks, before routing our troops in a savage counter-attack. With our forces being pushed out of the city, we were forced to request a ceasefire to escape further losses. The humiliating terms force us to withdraw our forces from all occupied territory within the Gaza Strip and acknowledge Egyptian control over it. Although being an embarrassing turn of events, we can at least be glad that the Egyptians had no intention of following up their victory, and our great nation remains secure."
 herut_conflict_11_desc:0 "Following the Israeli invasion of the Egyptian-held Gaza strip, the international community anxiously awaited results. In a surprise for many, the Israelis quickly overran Gaza, preventing the Egyptian forces from regrouping and drove them from the strip, forcing them to adopt new defensive positions in the Sinai Peninsula. The Israeli victory in Gaza has been an alarm for many, as Egypt has been widely perceived as being the strongest opponent of Israel. With the balance of power further altered, it remains to be seen whether the UN will take a stance against Israeli expansionism, with them now being in control of the entirety of the former British Mandate."
 herut_conflict_12_desc:0 "Following the Israeli invasion of the West Bank, many international observers looked on, aware of the wide-ranging impact the result of the conflict would have on the balance of power in the Middle East. In a decisive defeat for the Israeli Army, the Egyptians have driven them out and a ceasefire has been signed restoring the status quo. While this represents a considerable step in the Arab attempt at combating Israeli expansion, the Herut Government maintains steadfast in its expansionist values, and we still may not have seen the last of the Arab-Israeli conflicts in the Middle East."

Despite all of these setbacks, Mapai still appears to be as dominant as ever, but their position is still precarious with the moderate General Zionists rising in the polls, and with the hardline socialist Mapam, the religious HaPoel HaMizrachi and the fringe nationalist Herut all campaigning intensely against them. who shall emerge victorious?

Can Mapai stay in their dominant position? or will the government's incompetence regarding the captured spies weaken their position and perhaps, allow another party to take the leadership?

 BEN_GURION_DESC:0 "David Ben-Gurion, the long time de-facto leader of the labour Zionist movement and now the first Prime Minister of Israel. Ben-Gurion always had his suspicions for both the far-left and far-right, refusing to include the fellow socialist Mapam in his coalition and utterly refusing to listen to any of the nationalist Herut's demands. He also believes that Israel should retaliate to inflitrations and attacks from Arab countries and will do anything for Israel to be a force to be reckoned with. For now he remains unchallenged, but sooner or later, he could be replaced by the ever more influential younger generations who seek to replace the older generation of the Second Aliyah who held dominance over politics of the Zionist movement and now the Jewish State."
 Sharett_desc:0 "Moshe Sharett is a very different figure than David Ben-Gurion, he is a dove in a party filled with hawks and prefers to use diplomacy to achieve his goals rather than take up arms. When Israel was established, he was appointed as Foreign Minister, he served in that post dilligently, scheduling meetings between David Ben-Gurion and Arab leaders. Sharett opposes aggression or 'adventurism' and believes that Israel needs to be satisfied with the 1949 borders in order for peace to exist in this turmultous region. Even while being a minority in Mapai, he was given the nomination by the party and now serves as Prime Minsiter of Israel."
 israel.9.d:0 "In a remarkable discovery over recent years, scrolls containing ancient Jewish manuscripts have been found in the Qumran Caves. These caves are near the Dead Sea, a Salt Lake located in the hotly contested region of the West Bank. While the scrolls themselves were discovered in 1947, it’s only in more recent years that teams have made efforts to excavate them. As the historical significance of them has become more and more apparent, their value has increased and the search progress has subsequently accelerated rapidly. After five years of excavations, the last scrolls have finally been recovered from the cave. In total there are 972 manuscripts with 7 scrolls, found in a total of 11 caves. The recovery of these ancient scrolls represents a considerable step forward for the study of both the Jewish faith and the Hebrew Language, as the rush to understand the contents of the scrolls has began."

While the state will have to adjust to taking care of such a rapidly increasing population, the immigrants are full of joy and hope upon reaching their new home where they shall finally live free."
 israel.11.d:0 "Ever since the establishment of the country, there was a great debate on what the school curriculum should look like. Mapai and other secular parties want children to have a general education similar to that in the West, while HaPoel HaMizrachi, Mizrachi and other Ultra-Orthodox parties want to introduce religious education to 'revive the Jewish spirit of the nation'. This debate doesn't seem close to ending since Prime Minister Ben-Gurion has to appease both sides in order to keep his increasingly unstable coalition together."
 israel.12.d:0 "The Palmach, which fought valiantly alongside the IDF in the war of Indepdence, has been dissolved and integrated into the mainstream IDF, Ben-Gurion stated that he wants to 'de-politicze' the Palmach, as he sees it as too closely tied to Mapam, which he holds animosity and suspicion towards."

 lavonmania.2.d:0 "Following the agreement between our ally Britain and Egypt, who is hostile to us, to withdraw British forces from the Suez Canal by 1956, the IDF High Command was left nervous watching on. The Suez Canal is an important trading point for Israeli ships, and if Britain withdraws from the canal, Egypt could block Israeli ships from entering the canal. Followling that assesment, some men in the IDF High Command proposed the idea of initiating a false flag operation to bomb British owned businesses near the Canal, in order to give an air of instability and convince the British to withdraw from the treaty and remain in the canal. This idea was largely rejected by most of the IDF High Command who proposed that Israel should try and remain diplomatic without taking any reckless measures."
