Today, he finally held it.\nThe speech was "a solemn moment in a decidedly unsolemn time", warning a nation "giddy with prosperity, infatuated with youth and glamour, and aiming increasingly for the easy life." Despite being a politician with a military background and the only general to be elected president in the 20th century, he famously warned the nation with regards to the corrupting influence of what he describes as the "military-industrial complex". He also expressed his up most concern for corruption of the scientific process as part of this centralization of funding in the Federal government."
 usa.2.d:0 "Big news have come from the Supreme Court. In a case, Hernandez v. Texas, 347 U.S. 475,a unanimous ruling was made, where the court held that Mexican Americans and all other nationality groups in the United States had equal protection under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The ruling was written by Justice Earl Warren. This was the first case in which Mexican-American lawyers had appeared before the US Supreme Court.\nThe ruling is seen as an extension of protection in the Civil Rights Movement to minority groups within the country and an acknowledgement that, in certain times and places, groups other than blacks could be discriminated against."

 kef.10.d:0 "Massive amounts of arrests and investigations were done today, as the federal government declared a national crackdown on juvenile delinquents, citing the rapid increase of youth related crimes over the past decade. According to the Department of Justice, the amount of youth related crimes has exacerbated over the years. As such, law and order cannot be maintained, and juvenile delinquents have been given lax treatment by the judicial system. Civil rights organizations condemn this act, for it preys on the rights of the youth, and is very prone to abuse."
 kef.7.d:0 "The American Medical Association has come under fire today, as recent reports circulate that its donors, mostly big pharmaceutical and medical equipment companies, have influenced its policies and lobbying agendas, making them complicit in corruption and conflicts of interest scandal. The scandal, involving the highest echelons of the organization, were recently given vast sums of donations, half of it goes to themselves and half goes to the organization, in return for favors and influence in the organization’s policy. The American Medical Association has yet to respond, but observers state that it would far reaching consequences in the future."
 kef.3.d:0 "President of the United States Estes Kefauver has recently been praised by various civil rights organizations, as the President is embarking on a massive civil rights campaign, calling for the empowerment of minorities and their integration to American society. In a privileged speech, Kefauver said that it is the obligation of the American people to treat everyone equally, regardless of race, religion, sexuality, and other aspects, and judge people solely on a person’s character rather than skin color. This however has seen backlash by various white supremacist groups throughout the country, condemning his actions and demand an immediate retraction."
 sab_army_mc.1.d:0 "The McCarthy Hearings have been suspended until further notice today, as recent evidence showing the incompetence of various military officials in said hearings, virtually giving them no right to judge Joseph McCarthy, one of Washington’s most prominent senators who has come under controversy for releasing documents pertaining to alleged communist officials in the US Government. This development is a major victory for the Senator, as he can finally continue his so-called “crusade against communism”, a phrase coined by his various supporters. Observers say that should McCarthy continue such crusade, we will be looking at not only a more anti-communist America, but a more undemocratic America."
 cultural_events.9.d:0 "The world community saw the passing of one of it's great, unsung protectors today as English cryptographer Alan Turing was found dead in what appears to be an act of suicide; Doctor Turing, 41, is considered to be the forefather of modern computer science and played no small role in the cracking of "Enigma" the Nazi German navel codes, a key role that aided the allied war effort in the Battle of the Atlantic among others; he is believed to be potentially responsible for saving upwards of 14 million lives and even shortening the length of the second world war by as long two years, The British government has been quick to distance themselves from the death of Turing, however, homosexual laws in the British Isles being what they are, Turing had been forced to stand trial for the crime of being a homosexual and the cryptographer was sentenced to chemical castration not ten years before his untimely passing.\nWhatever controversy that haunted Turing in life, in death, he shall be remembered as the spearhead into the heart of the Axis war machine and a pivotal figure in saving Britain, Europe, and, indeed, the world from fascism and tyranny."
 kef.8.d:0 "In a fiery speech before congress, American president Estes Kefauver has publicly denounced the Southern Manifesto. Signed in March 1956 in response to Brown vs Board, it is the main base of Southern opposition to increasingly persistent federal efforts at desegregation. His speech was met with reactions varying from praise to accusations of treason, even by members of his own Democratic party. With the president committing himself to the cause of desegregation, tensions with the those who advocate for maintaining the status quo have increased considerably. Kefauver himself now faces widespread opposition from Dixiecrat influences in his party, although this is partially offset by increasing support from those sympathetic to the civil rights movement. One thing that is certain, however, is that the process of desegregating American society has been greatly sped up by these developments - and the south may have to embrace the winds of change blowing their way."
 phi_events.2.d:0 "Violence and civil unrest run rampant throughout Manila and the entirety of the Philippine archipelago, as various student activists, civic groups, and opposition factions, most of which have direct links to the Communist Party of the Philippines, have been organizing demonstrations and protests condemning the rule of President Ferdinand Marcos and his supposed American masters. Reports have circulated that these demonstrations have rapidly escalated to large scale violence, as these demonstrators have already attacked various government districts, such as Mendiola, which is near proximity to Malacanang Palace, the official residence of the President, and the American embassy, which according to the militants is the de facto seat of power in the Philippines. In response to such acts of violence, President Ferdinand Marcos mobilized the Philippine Constabulary and broke up the demonstrations violently, if necessary. With the rapid increase in civil unrest, along with the Communist threat reaching the academia, observers predict that the Marcos government will institute radical measures to quell rebellion and the Communist threat."
 phi_events.3.d:0 "On September 23, 1972, President Ferdinand Marcos has just signed Proclamation No. 1081, a presidential proclamation declaring Martial Law throughout the entire Philippine archipelago. According to President Marcos, Martial Law was declared due to the decay of law and order, along with the ever growing threat of Communism which has gained rapid momentum, claiming that they are in the final works of a revolutionary uprising against his government. Opposition groups claim however that the vast majority of terrorist attacks experienced by the Philippines were orchestrated by the President’s inner circle of military generals to promote fear and terror amongst the populace, thereby giving legitimacy to his declaration. Nevertheless, the implementation of Martial Law was swift, with the Armed Forces of the Philippines or AFP, able to secure strategic areas detrimental to the Marcos regime, and the implementation of the “General Orders” placed on the proclamation. Observers are mixed with their response to this declaration, as some sympathize with the government, while others criticize it, believing in the story of the opposition."
 kef.9.d:0 "In a decisive move by President Kefauver of the United States, the process for nominating Democratic candidates has been radically altered to increase the effectiveness of the manner in which Democratic presidential candidates are selected. Traditionally, candidates were selected primarily in secret by party leaders, sometimes resulting in the selection of candidates who had never run as a delegate in a primary election. The President has put forward guidelines on how candidates should be selected, swiftly modernising the nomination process to take into account the will of the people and effectively forcing states to select their delegates via Presidential Primaries. The result of this reform is that the Democratic voters have a much larger role in the outcome than they had previously, and the move has taken a significant amount of power out of the hands of powerful politicians and into the hands of the people. It’s now clear that the future Democratic candidates will represent the people more than they did in previous elections. Whether this will have an effect on future elections remains to be seen."
