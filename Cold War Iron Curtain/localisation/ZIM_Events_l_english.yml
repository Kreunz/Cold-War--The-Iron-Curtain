 rho.2.d:0 "Earlier today Ian Smith announced that Rhodesia, a British territory in southern Africa that had governed itself since 1923, now regarded itself as an independent sovereign state. It is the first unilateral break from the United Kingdom by one of its colonies since the United States Declaration of Independence nearly two centuries before. The UK, the Commonwealth and the United Nations all have deemed Rhodesia's UDI illegal, and economic sanctions by the UN have already been planned.\n A stalemate developed between the British and Rhodesian prime ministers between 1964 and 1965. Dispute largely surrounded the British condition that the terms for independence had to be acceptable "to the people of the country as a whole"; Smith contended that this was met, while the UK and black Rhodesian leaders in Rhodesia held that it was not.\n Ian Smith has told that despite this, they would still be loyal to the Queen Elizabeth II."
