 rho.2.d:0 "Earlier today Ian Smith announced that Rhodesia, a British territory in southern Africa that had governed itself since 1923, now regarded itself as an independent sovereign state. It is the first unilateral break from the United Kingdom by one of its colonies since the United States Declaration of Independence nearly two centuries before. The UK, the Commonwealth and the United Nations all have deemed Rhodesia's UDI illegal, and economic sanctions by the UN have already been planned.\n A stalemate developed between the British and Rhodesian prime ministers between 1964 and 1965. Dispute largely surrounded the British condition that the terms for independence had to be acceptable \"to the people of the country as a whole\"; Smith contended that this was met, while the UK and black Rhodesian leaders in Rhodesia held that it was not.\n Ian Smith has told that despite this, they would still be loyal to the Queen Elizabeth II."
 rho.3.d:0 "Conferences at Victoria Falls and London have led to the formation of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, consisting of three divisions: Nyasaland, Northern Rhodesia, and Southern Rhodesia. The Federation was formally created after the British Parliament enacted the Rhodesia and Nyasaland Federation Act. The Act has subsequently been authorized by the Queen."
 rho.4.d:0 "The United Nations Security Council last week took a historic step, of sorts. For the first time in its 21 years of existence, it resorted to mandatory economic sanctions to try to bring down a government.\nObject of the sanctions was Ian Smith's white-supremacist regime in Rhodesia, which has been deplored as an international renegade ever since it broke away from British rule 13 months ago. By a vote of eleven to zero—with four abstentions—the council declared an international embargo on 90% of Rhodesia's exports, forbade the U.N.'s 122-member nations to sell oil, arms, motor vehicles or airplanes to the rebel territory or to provide it with any form of financial or other economic aid.\nHowever, it is predicted that the sanctions will have no actual effect. Voted down was an amendment to penalize nations that ignore the boycott. The Security Council left it up to each member nation to police its own trade with Rhodesia. Shortly after last week's vote, South Africa, which supplies most of Rhodesia's oil and is its principal trading partner, announced that it had no intention of obeying the resolution. Without South African cooperation, the sanctions seem doomed to fail."
 rho.129.d:0 "Rhodesia has been reconnected to the world by a new air line: Air Rhodesia. Due to sanctions on all international flights to Rhodesia imposed due to the Rhodesian Government's declaration of independence, the Air Rhodesia Corporation only has international flights to the friendly state of Malawi planned. An initial route of Salisbury to Blantyre is currently being offered on Vickers Viscounts which were inherited from their former parent company, Central African Airways."
