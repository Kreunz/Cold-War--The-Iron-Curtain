Following Two Balance Each other Out
	
	-Increased Liberty Desire increases the drift for democratic ideologies, can also cause backlash

	-Military Integration changes army stats, at low levels represents lack of a coherent military, at higher levels it can lead to radical coups
	

	
In each case, the government's attempt to protect itself by expanding the military apparatus and suppressing opposition undermined its own authority. 

In Ethiopia, the age-old political system lost its legitimacy as a result of economic growth,

expansion of modern education, and the appearance of new social classes. The values which 

sanctioned the monopolization of power by Emperor Haile Selassie, the chief executive, chief

legislator, and chief dispsensor of justice were rejected by modernist social forces. The foiled

coup d'etat in 1960 constituted a turning point. On the other hand, in both Somalia and Sudan,

the penetration of democratic values to the level of the elite was very limited, given the

authoritarian rules of Britain and Italy. Political parties were regional and clan-specific in

character failing to promote a national outlook.


However, the continued inability of the Imperial Government of Ethiopia and successive

Sudanese leaders to protect themselves by centralization of authority and suppression of popular

demands led to a takeover by "radical" military governments. Yet the opportunities offered by

the radical military coups in the Sudan under the leadership of Colonel Ja'afar Numeiri, in

Somalia in 1969 under General Siyaad Barre, and in Ethiopia in 1974 failed to create autonomous

roles for the states or to promote progressive state building.
